Well, I can identify with what they are really saying about the homelessness, and about Mass Ave. I work in that area and it has never been like that, and it is really sad that people are not taking the heat to what's really going on. These are human beings and they do have problems that we all have. Some of us can come up out of it, and some of us can not. They are homeless, but they are allowing them to live in the street, and not giving them the stuff that they need in order to get well. I work in that area, and I see the tents, I walk by the tents. I feed the hungry at my job. The hungry, I mean I feed families at my job where I'm at. Every morning when I go there at 6:30. In the park, all I see is a lot of tents. They are beautiful people. I talk to them, and when you look at them and you hear their story. As small as a mustard seed of what happened to them, and all they are asking for is help. Basically the city should be ashamed of themselves in that we have a big population of the homeless that's in Boston. Now, back in the day, I had a sister that was out there too. It was a long time ago, and a sister is someone that you really love and you really want to do what you can, but you can never understand her situation. So I feel really bad for them, because they do have families like my sister did. But that is what she chose to do. Just like the both of you said, we need to help. That should be number one of every ones list, to try to get help for these young men and young women. That's part of homelessness, and Boston has never been like that before. It's okay. One quick thing, I think that... I think that, we are all on here today, they need people like us to help absolve this homeless problem. We could be homeless in a minute, just like Mrs. Webb said. We can, but we have the tools to help these people. We are sitting in our homes, we are looking at the news and we are trying to understand what's going on, and we got the answer here, but we can't voice our opinions.

And being single, being Asian, first generation, is very. Being a struggle, I move in different towns in Boston. I'm reaching for Brookline and now I'm in Allston. But Brookline, I still consider Brookline and stuff. So that's why I was hesitant to say anything about where I live, because different towns are slightly different. I worked in different towns as a case manager too. So I know how it is working with families [inaudible]. I was a case manager at the DCF and all that. So I had that experience working with them and knowing that, and me now living here, it's totally different, even though it's a town over. So that's why I have many different skills and jobs just to survive, especially on your own, doing it. And just continue doing it and continue education, times change. But it's very difficult and it's yeah, it's very difficult, especially a woman and being minority, they still see that and there's still stereotypes. What you should do, what you shouldn't do and being first generation is very difficult because everyone in my family's married and have kids and I'm single, much later in life than everyone here. Even though I might look young, I have the energy more of younger stuff. I have more energy earlier, it's more a quiet time. Yeah, so it's a very difficult and being disabled somewhat, I can say right now, it's a struggle because I don't get benefits. The disabled person to have stereotype. I have to still work really hard and justify if I do get anything, every year's review. So it's a very hard struggle doing that, on top of you were struggling early trying to make a living here, buying a place on your own and stuff. And not getting much help, being single, is not nice because people have kids, they get all these benefits, right? Everyone's to their own, but for me, being single, you don't get benefits. Now, people get benefits and have kids, right? So they have the extra money and stuff coming in, right? Single ones are the ones you see they're struggling working right now with COVID going because they have to. So it's very difficult and it's unfair really. So hopefully that does change and there's more incentive for being single and being happy being single. You don't have to necessarily be married, or a couple, or anything like that.

When I say that, there is nothing in Boston, like it was before. For our children, there're no centers, there're no activities. There's nothing to make them feel like they belong to the city of Boston. We have to fight so how for them. My experience in my life goes back to my three sons. I was a single mother and I was raising three sons, and all I heard all through their lives was statistics, crime. You know they're not going to be this, they are not going to be that. You know people were putting them down, their peer people were putting them down as a young African American child. Schools, Community Centers. Just people that they looked up too. So, that led me to fight for them. To travel with them. To make sure that they're okay. To make sure that they earn and get what they need to get out of Boston as I did for a child that my mother gave me. I wanted them to believe in their selves that they can accomplish anything in life. They could do anything they want in life. Nothing, no word, no action could take place in theirs lives that would stop them. That just made me get more into their education. It made me follow through their education, until I made sure that they were okay to able to stand up and finish the rest of their lives as men. To not be statistics, not go to jail, not do this, not do that. The city of Boston has to understand that it is all about our children.

So, my mission is to fight for our children.

I want to carry their voices on my back, and once we get where we are going I want to take them off my back and put them in front of me and make sure that they are able to talk as loud as they can and accomplish everything they can.

I was reading a lot about gentrification and how these colleges and universities that are here are causing a lot of the problem, because people get big jobs with big salaries and then they stay here and then they cause the cost of rentals to rise. And also, just there's so many students, so the demand is so high. And yeah, all these issues.

I don't know, the prices aren't even comparable to like a little apartment here in Brighton, which is just interesting. And I think that for some, while at the same time, as some colleges and universities, they're causing these issues. But I think that students can afford to live in these situations and pay the prices and that's causing the costs to rise. But I feel like with my PhD stipend, it's very low. And I'm from a low SES family. And my parents can't afford to help me, which I know is happening for some other students in my program. So it's definitely really a struggle just to make ends meet and meet my rent. And when I was choosing programs and comparing them, I was talking to people who live here for a while, like the faculty and students and things like that. And a big thing they said was, ""We can't change it, but this stipend is really hard to live on, especially with the cost of living in Boston, how high it is. And we're not going to lie to you, this is just how it is."" So, that was something I knew coming in.

And one of the things that is so important that I've learned over the course of doing this work is to listen to native raised native communities and nations about what they think is really going to solve... No, solve is the wrong word. But that what's really going to help native people? And I think everyone's really concerned about climate and the future. And native communities have a lot of knowledge and wisdom about that, and are very much outside of capitalism. So there's just a way that I think people want to kind of keep the system the way that it is now and think that they can still solve climate change.

I'm currently in a community service club here at Northeastern, and one of the things that we did was a culture walk. So we were able to walk around all the different communities and neighborhoods that surround Northeastern, like Roxbury and Dorchester. And we went through all different communities of Boston that I've personally not been to before. And something that was kind of eye opening to me was that I didn't, since I've never been to them before, I didn't really know that they were there. And it was kind of like a very reflective experience because I was wondering why I haven't been to those communities before and why this club that I was participating in thought we would benefit from these walks. And I realized that it is so important to familiarize yourself with the communities that surround you. Especially since the Northeastern campus is kind of, it can be kind of isolating if you don't walk beyond the borders of it, it can feel like its own little isolated place where everything is all students, and all... this one type of community and culture and academic rigor. But you walk just like 10 minutes outside of the campus lines and there's a whole different community and culture at play. So that was something that was very eye-opening to me. And I think that's why I came to that question, because even though I did engage in those neighborhood and community walks, I still want to learn more about it. And I still want to be confident in my familiarity with those communities. And I want to be able to hopefully one day see myself as a part of that community too.

It's a human rights issue and if we have all of this room to build million-dollar McMansions in Dorchester and billion-dollar skyscrapers and high-rises that are sitting empty, we definitely have the ability to build more affordable housing. I saw an article yesterday that the BPDA, which is the Boston Planning and Development Association, I think, they approved something like 940 units of housing for the city of Boston. 172 of those units are listed as affordable. And affordable is a misnomer. We have way more people who are living down in... closer to the extremely low income level in this city, who cannot find housing because it is so ridiculous. But housing-affordable goes all the way up to, in some neighborhoods, $120,000 a year. That is insane. A person who is making $20,000 a year cannot compete in the same market as a person who is making $120,000 a year. And so...

I think it's Pamela that was talking about housing and how she grew up here and over the years has seen a transformation, or what we would call gentrification now. And I think it's a real need. I wasn't born here, so I don't know anything about that, but I have read so much to understand that it's a reality. And so, having spent the last, like I said, spent the last 13 years now, in Boston, I think I could, to a large extent, say I have seen it, but also I have listened to many stories. It resonates with me and I think too, to that point, is that having conversations like this and making sure that folks like Pamela, and many others who have lived here, do not leave here to go to Brockton or go to another place, it's real. And so we need to fight together. It is, whether you are new to Boston or just coming to Boston yesterday, or even arrive in Boston today, the conversation should be ongoing. I think too, and then to Kelly's point with the mental crisis, anytime I drive past the Methadone Miles I weep for this country. One, I know I'm a Nigerian, so in case you're wondering who did this, so keep talking, and I've traveled around the world to know when I see [inaudible], it baffles me that we live in a country with so much abundance and yet people are dying. It's... I just can't understand what's happening, but yet it feels like this happened in my country. It's going to be all over the world that Nigeria is blah, blah, blah. All of those African countries are black, but yet if I could take pictures and show it to my folks in Nigeria, they will laugh at me. But anyway, that's a different conversation. So I say that this is a reality, and we have to do that together, irrespective of where we come from. Whether you're old or new, it's a fight that we have to do and I think, like I said, I'm also coming from a spiritual... Today's kind of a day that the Lord has made. But I remember this, just this in regards to the Old Testament, sorry, I'm going to go a little bit fate, where the Bible talks about even those that are poor, the rich, when they go to glean their land, the Bible tells us that they allow, they don't glean everything, they allow for the poor. But we don't see that happen now. What we see is the people who claim everything and the poor doesn't have opportunity to glean behind them. And so when people go to harvest, what I'm saying is that they leave something for the poor. And what we're seeing is that the rich, [inaudible] goes grab everything is that's there. They grab as much as they could. They could even clear everything so the poor doesn't have anything on the street. And that's the result of what we see happen here. And so that's one story that resonates with me. And, like I said, I'm here. Part of the rules, it goes to tie to my own passion of seeing young people, that they don't have to live like their parents. I've got two boys and this is a fight that I have to do for them.

When I talk about my story, it's painful, it's like reliving trauma. I talk about the times being spit on by drunken white boys and go on to Cub Scout when I was nine years old. That's painful to talk about, because I could still smell the liquor in the spit, which has a bad smell. I mean, I talk about being a young kid growing up in Mission Hill running a major community center and was initiated with Charles Stuart murder when a pregnant white woman was alleged killed by a black man, and those are all a hunt for every black men, civil rights savagely violated, pants pulled down in front of the center, I was going to become the director, couldn't happen to me. That's painful, so I can go on and on. One of the officials in that year, when we started dunk the boat doing a couple of years later in 1992, one of the officials was my brother who was murdered on Christmas Day in 1992. So, when you talk about stories, and then you're asking people to come tell this story, that brings knowledge to those who are collecting it and look at us as being experiments. So, I think it's important that we compensate when we talk about equity, when we talk about reaching people that have been overlooked, mistreated, literally written off, and then you're asking them to relive that experience, it's painful. So, that's why I was hesitant. And you're going to hear many stories like that, and it is traumatic to go through this. I'm sitting here with people that I love, I'm sitting here with people that I trust, but it's still painful to even talk about what I'm experiencing. So, that's why I was hesitant in telling that story. So, as I continue with this project, and as I talked to my staff and those that are part of this campaign, take into consideration that people are dealing with a lot of stuff, whether it's health, whether it's poverty, and whether they feel comfortable being able to tell this story. The people that don't look like them, that they don't trust, that they don't want to tell their business, that they don't want to hear from them how to be black, and what we need.

They had more sense of responsibility in terms of the unit. And now, there's no sense of responsibility. It's like a hotel room, essentially.

And I was thinking a lot about inequality, which is definitely highlighted there. And then I was reading lots of articles about Boston and the issues people were facing. And I wanted to know about my specific area, I was moving into this Brighton and Allston area. And I guess what my role would be and what my place would be moving in here? I was reading a lot about gentrification and how these colleges and universities that are here are causing a lot of the problem, because people get big jobs with big salaries and then they stay here and then they cause the cost of rentals to rise. And also, just there's so many students, so the demand is so high. And yeah, all these issues.

I don't know, the prices aren't even comparable to like a little apartment here in Brighton, which is just interesting. And I think that for some, while at the same time, as some colleges and universities, they're causing these issues. But I think that students can afford to live in these situations and pay the prices and that's causing the costs to rise. But I feel like with my PhD stipend, it's very low. And I'm from a low SES family. And my parents can't afford to help me, which I know is happening for some other students in my program. So it's definitely really a struggle just to make ends meet and meet my rent. And when I was choosing programs and comparing them, I was talking to people who live here for a while, like the faculty and students and things like that. And a big thing they said was, ""We can't change it, but this stipend is really hard to live on, especially with the cost of living in Boston, how high it is. And we're not going to lie to you, this is just how it is."" So, that was something I knew coming in.

But the problem with the housing issue that both of us faced is really the same that Boston does not have a lot of housing stock and the housing stock they're building is not going to help, because it doesn't serve families, and children, especially, these high rises are very dangerous for children. There's nowhere for them to play and so forth, so the housing issue still is critical to many groups of people whether they're homeowners or tenants, whether they're young, or old, or retired, or students, we all are vying for the same piece of the pie here. And the pie is very small to begin with, because this is a small town and this is the problem. Boston has always been a small town and we've always been somewhat in denial about it. And the problem now is, is because the other issue involving construction has reduced the amount of green space. I didn't bring that up, which also is going to contribute to the adverse effects of climate change, because we have fewer trees here, we have a heat sink here in Allston because of the amount of concrete it's going to raise the temperature, that's going to use more electricity, more energy. So, we're making it worse, and at the same time, we're looking at thousands of students pouring back into the city in another few weeks and they're going to be looking for housing. And I think, I personally believe that the rents should come down, and I know their arguments against that. I had a rent controlled apartment, it worked fine for many years. I don't think people understood the law actually, which is why they voted it out. But I think that someone's got to give, it's one of those things where everybody's pulling in the same direction, somebody's got to give a little bit up here in this equation. And well, Michael, I mean, you solved your problem personally, you're not in a housing crisis yourself, but the issue continues.

A little bit of what was mentioned earlier about affordability, but for me personally, being more trying to figure out what the best word would be, but I guess accessibility in essence. And in particular with young families. So you have the Lead laws for housing, and we were ghosted by realtor brokers and homeowners when we were looking for places to live here in Boston. Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices. So it makes it very difficult to think of a future here in Boston, when you're dealing with a housing situation on a lease by lease basis, and not sure if you'll even be allowed, from the sense of a realtor or a homeowner, to even begin to look for places here in Boston.

But everyone is just like, ""Oh, go to this neighborhood, then go to that neighborhood."" And I think people don't think like why different neighborhoods are different. And I one of the things we always noticed, is just differences in education, differences in support system within each community. And I think like all these things make me think of how each community, with more help or with more funding, can be helped more. And have, for example, more safety within Boston. And I think a lot of people have concerns about going to different neighborhoods, just because of what they think that neighborhood is, or what each neighborhood could be like. And especially coming from abroad, everyone's tells you not to go to a certain neighborhood within Boston, or they just say, ""Oh, all this neighborhood is just the same way.""

It was a three family house we were living in, raise my rent from 700 to 1100 in one year and I had to move. And so, we moved to Jamaica Plain. And then several years later... I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it.

She's 48, bought a house in Philadelphia for 200 and something thousand dollars, could never, even though she makes a lot of money with her partner. So, that's my question. And that's my story.

Now, the problem is that Walsh, because of his ties to construction industry let developers take over this initiative and the developers, they're not so interested in quality of life issues or even in costs. Now they came up with this term called affordable housing, which is actually a developers term and what it amounts to is a slight reduction of rent for a year. Now, that's not really going to help a lot of people in the long run, but it provided the developers with an excuse who I erect here in my part of towns, literally hundreds of high rises, which is going to have a completely disastrous effect in terms of climate change issues in the near future, and the delivery of city services, including water and sewer, electric service is going to be deteriorated because every source has already said they don't want to provide more equipment. So we're facing a crisis of infrastructure mainly, and also a surging population that we can't possibly handle, because I mean, the rat situation here in this part of town is already out of control, as you know rats bring disease and cause other problems. So we're looking at, between one issue and the other, we're looking at it very large deficit in terms of quality of life in the near future. What can be done about it? Well I do have a solution, but nobody wants to hear it. Somebody, an entity or a group, needs to file a class action suit against the BPDA. Nobody wants to do that because they're a very powerful organization, but I don't see another solution. I spent all day with these groups online, discussing these issues, so I'm pretty well-informed, but we'll end up saying the same thing, ""We feel powerless to do anything about it.""

I think there are important folks, important leaders, people who don't have enough voice, I would say, or enough ownership with what they're doing and how they're creating community and leading. So my question is really, how do we start to preserve the legacy and educate people in the educational system as well, but also start to educate people in the neighborhoods about the values and the landmarks, so that we could have more control over what we do.

I know this because I'm in Upham's Corner community, and I feel like a lot of the people who I feel are leaders, are not represented enough to be able to carry through with their legacy, and with the moves that they want to make, because we don't have a place where the vision is held, like archived of all this stuff. Where we can say, ""This is proven to be done and we need these people back again."" I just think that there should be more say. A lot of people should have a better say, more voice around what they want to see in their community. But we have to preserve the legacy and also bring that back into the educational system, which will hopefully amplify the historical landmarks that we have, so they can't be erased.

So I see the present health concern of mental health and the stability of its Boston residents, that it should be brought to the forefront of the table, because if we can't start from within ourselves, how can we build community? How can we keep the neighborhoods together? How can we unify?

He was very social, and the pandemic really crumbled him down to almost just a shell. And where someone is just starting off their life at 18, it seems so sad that you would get to this point, but it was out of your control. So it's like, how do you help him? And even as myself as a mental health advocate and counselor, it was hard for me to work from within the home because I'm always working with clients outside of the home. So when it hit home that my son was depressed and like, he just didn't want to get up for school. Like he would roll to the bed and wake up, turn the laptop on and be in class in the bed and just not present at all. So it was so sad to watch that for, like, he struggled to get out of school. And the way the school system was set up, it was like they did everything to ease the kids so they could just get out. But to me, I still think that they weren't ready. The pandemic did push them back, but because of what was needed, like through policy or government, that they had to get these kids out of these seats for the next batch to come in. And also with making them come back in this year, I don't know, to me it was like a force as well, because a lot of people are still getting sick. But just having that reflection of young people just going into a shell, it really resonated with me that that also occurred. And that was on the day of the shutdown where my son actually, he just went missing. He just kept walking around and hanging with friends. We had no idea where he was. And that was the scariest time that I ever experienced something like that with one of my own children. I'd never saw that happening with him because he knows how we are and how we'll wrap our arms around him. So it was just so, like... I guess I was out of this world. Yeah. Because it was like, we couldn't find him, the pandemic happened, they sent the kids home, we don't know what's going on. And it just was, yeah, bananas, pure chaos.

So when, Mish I think you even talked about serenity and peace and whatever, it brought me to that, that we have increased the amount of noise due to people's irritation and frustration with those lanes. So I don't know if I'm doing a disservice to the people who are bicyclists.

Even starting from within my own household, even starting from within the family, like I've noticed so much from doing all the readings and the research and all that. It's like, it's really there, but why was that always frowned upon that this is the buildup that's going to burst as to why nothing got done about it, or people didn't know how to speak to their physicians or just bring it out. It was like, what happens in the house stays in the house. Mm. And that's not always a good way to rear children or young youth, because it's like, ""All right, so what do I tell? What do I not? But I still need this help."" So it's, I don't know, it's always been so confusing, but when it happened for my child, I made sure to do everything that I could. And even though I wasn't an advocate for mental health at that time, I knew that it was something that was real. Even though I don't like the way that it was brought up from the school system, because sometimes people don't have of empathy for ways that they deliver messages. So it was kind of, you get on the defense first, before you really accept what was being said about your child or what they noticed. Right. So that needs to be taken account of, like a revamp for those resources in the school to get them some kind of training as well when they deliver those kind of messages to parents about their observance of their student or that person's child. But yeah, so mental health is still really a big forefront because if you don't have sense of self, everything around you is going to always be in pieces. Hm. Okay. So you start in there to get those pieces together so that you can have the coping skills, you can have mechanisms that you can reach for and resources for people that you can reach out to. So, that's my main concern. And to piggyback off with Ms. Carol, the crime is really getting ridiculous. I sat here the other night, and I did hear that those 25 shots that that person got dumped in the other day up on Walk Hill. And I could sit... I was sitting on the couch and I heard each shot and I said, ""Oh my goodness."" I didn't know where it came from, but to find out that it came from Walk Hill, that's still a distance from me.

I was, as I mentioned before, the guns, I work a later shift and I get home sometimes after nine o'clock and when I get home after nine o'clock, I'm concerned with nothing other than coming down from the T station. I'm glad the commuter rail is just right up the street from where I live because I take the commuter rail. I no longer take the red line or the buses. I'll get on the commuter rail, go into work, go into the office. I'm so concerned when I get out of the office because I work at the C point area which is very safe. There's always tons of people walking around. There's the long wharf and then there's the international, Intercontinental, I'm sorry, Hotel so there's always a bunch of tourists around. There's always transit police and police because it's the downtown area so I'm not concerned so much walking from my office when it's dark at night, ask the eight o'clock to south station. But sometimes when I arrived Blue Hill Labs Station where I get off, there's a big old long platform and a big old long ramp. So what I did was I was, because sometimes people are just sitting there. I don't know, maybe, watching trains but it's late at night, they're just sitting there guys. So what I did was I asked the engineer, I said, ""Look, when you get to Blue Hill Avenue, could you possibly pull closest possible to that ramp?"" And he said, ""You ain't going towards the rebuilt area?"" And I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Yeah."" He said, ""That's a long platform."" I said, ""Yes it is."" And he said, ""That's a long ramp."" And I said, ""I'm glad you know that."" He said, ""I never know where to stop because some people do when they exit the train, they go towards the Blue Hill Lab but I go towards Cummins Highway because I live on that side.""

They're sitting in a car or outside of our car and then the grandmother that was just sitting on her porch and some random shooting or something like that. Where do these...

Like today on the news, there was stuff about them trying to give the people on the Methadone Mile totes and all those tents, and this and that. Now, our city was never like that, I was born and raised here, and I just turned 71, there wasn't no Methadone Miles or all of this, so I really believe that the government needs to do more to encourage people to like... put them in a house somewhere where they can gain their independence so they're not sleeping in a tent. Giving them a tote and they're already frustrated, the rents in Boston are ridiculous, so a lot of people became homeless because of that, then the war on drugs, which there really isn't but there's a lot of drugs here so drug people are migrating from other parts of the city and ending up in the middle of Boston. So I care that the government needs to deal with that issue, with this homelessness. Instead of giving these people a tote, give them a room and somewhere to live. I want our future mayors to realize this, you know what I'm saying? All that, ""Oh, you can leave your tent, here's a tote, we're not displacing you.""

I am super blessed that I'm a homeowner and I chose to purchase my first home here in Dorchester. I didn't go to the burbs like most people who grow up in this neighborhood do. I am really invested in really elevating the economy of Dorchester. I think gentrification is real and it's really happening. I actually celebrated 12 years of being a homeowner this October, 16th- Yeah! Yay! Thank you. It was hard. It was hard. But when you look at it, the amount of rent that you pay for an apartment, is almost double what you can pay for a mortgage. And it's real. My entire family is with me. My sister was homeless as well, jumping from apartment to apartment when she came from California. And so, my home, house as it's home to my parents, well, my father passed away, but my mom and my sister. And we're all in the family. And we feel blessed, but we've all been homeless at one point in our lifetime. And so, it's really... it hits close to home when I drive... Even next door I have a homeless gentleman that sleeps next door to my home, and it makes me really sad. There's enough homes in this City to house every single citizen here.

And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn't so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, ""Hi neighbor."" That's our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, ""Hey, how you're doing?"" So, that's missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there. And if we need to, we need to build another table that's big enough to accommodate everybody so that we can all be a part of the conversation.",dorchester,"['institutions', 'community life']","['processes', 'community resources', 'call to action', 'community relationships', 'community values']",215.29999999999973,430.59999999999945

And the thing about my community, my street, is that we went from families who had lived there for decades, to my street now being very transient. People coming and going, people moving in, moving out. No longer family homes, family dwellings from generation to the next. But I think as I was listening to Gail, the thing that comes to mind for me is that it's like not having an infrastructure. It's like not building an infrastructure, so that everybody who comes in, they come into something new. Imagine what it would be like if your community or your street is one that [inaudible] somebody new comes in, you realize they're new to the street. You welcome them for being new to the street, as opposed to looking at them and saying, ""Okay, I wonder how long they going to be here. I wonder how many cars they have. I wonder how many parking spaces are they going to take up?"" I mean, because that's just a reality now. But imagine that if we were in that time, when we actually made it a point to get to know people so that your street has an identity, your street has a culture. So that as people are coming in, it's not a chore to convince people to come to neighborhood association meetings, because the first time they see it or hear about it is not when you are shoving a notice in their mailbox, it's because you've actually had a conversation with them and you've mentioned it to them, you've told them about it. So that when it happens, you can say, ""Oh, remember I told you about that meeting, would you like to come with me?"" And I think that we have moved so far... I'm saying ""move."" Maybe we haven't grown or we have dissolved, I'm not even sure what it is, but I just know that we have moved away from that. And I'm just thinking that if we had something that even resembled that... Businesses and organizations survive when they have an infrastructure, right? When they have funds, when they have...

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, ""We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night."" And so for me, it was just very looking for, ""How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?"" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, ""Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens."" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, ""Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success."" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward.

And we teach our students that if you work hard and invest in yourself at some time down the road, you're going to be able to have financial stability. And that is such a scam that we teach young people, because it doesn't matter what industry you're in, there are so many barriers. I've had a ton of career just roadblocks because I'm a woman or because I'm Asian or because there's a misunderstanding about my level of education or knowledge. So there's all of these little roadblocks within individual experience that we don't address and when you keep telling people that you work hard, you'll get there. But it really depends on what industry you're in. When I worked in tech, it was insane to me that they were paying me so much just for an assistant level position whereas when I was doing something that I loved in design, I was making less than all of my peers. So no matter how hard I worked or how much further along, I move through moved up in whatever industry is like that, trying to close that gap was an uphill battle. It makes me frustrated, because it's not a lack of trying hard that people are struggling, it's not because people are lazy or because they're not educated. I know plenty of people who work in Starbucks and they have a PhD. So it really how do we want to address it because people do want to work and they do want to contribute and have legacy and have impact, but there are so many gatekeepers.

The things that were done in the South End. I mean, I think one of the things that Markeisha was talking about was the destruction of the West End where Mel King grew up, right? There was three jails there. When they destroyed the West End it had poor Irish, poor Italian, and poor Jews, and poor blacks. By the time it was destroyed and whites were allowed now or those three ethnic groups were now been seen as being white and no longer just ethnic groups of poor Italian, poor Irish, and poor Jew, they are now white, and they were able to leave the black community. And when I grew through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, I can remember smelling burning houses, and I can remember people talking about wetting their roofs so that ember from other houses that were going to be set on fire by people who were never moving back to the neighborhood, and would never sell their property as well, those are the same properties that are now along the Blue Hill half-quarter, all the way from lower Roxbury all the way into Mattapan Square to Milton. So, this has been my experience growing up here in Massachusetts and seeing this, the powers at be, the same structures exist.

When a developer comes in and wants to develop on public land owned by the city, and they want federal or state, or city tax credits, you don't get them unless we come up with a plan to make sure that there's packages of housing, for one, two, three, four, five room housing.""

A lot of people were in the room, and they were talking about a framework to be able... A Black agenda, unapologetically Black, not people of color, but a framework that had smart measures that were specific measurable, attainable, and had time sensitive markers. A report card with the NAACP, and they talked about... And subsequent to that, they got everybody's emails and phone numbers, and we broke up into break out groups, and we've been having conversations and even Senator Wilkerson, who does the Wakanda, who was instrumental in getting Rachael Rollins elected, and tried to endorse Janie, they have subsequently, or I think on today, are going to veer that framework that they came up with, that they are endorsing Wu.

So it's clear, it's a unified conversation that needs to be had, probably everybody on this call, but they can speak for themselves, has been impacted by gentrification. I know that my grandfather, who came from Barbados, in the early 1900s, bought a house on [Stromard] Avenue, and was gentrified out, in the 1980s. After having a house, well, it was his daughter, my mother, who actually received the house after he passed away, but she was gentrified out because it became unaffordable for her to live there, because of taxes. Now it's a multimillion dollar home, on the corner of Stromard and Massachusetts Avenue. As I said, five generations of Rocks have lived over and impacted in that house, and unfortunately, it's gone now.

So all that work that Judge [Garrity] did, to actually call for a one on one hiring, and to bring up the level of Black teachers, to be at the same level of the population of students, which was at the time around 23, 24%, everything has changed and nothing has changed in Boston, in terms of educational opportunity for Black folks.

Never, no one was doing violence. And we had a Team Center in every house [inaudible] around the city. Everybody did stuff together. We would bring all the developments together, that way there was never any conflict, but now they got everybody spaced out, no one likes each other, they fired all the workers.

Franklin Field and Bromley Heath that has an active running Task Force and Community Center and doing things for the people and the community. And we need that everywhere. We need the Mayor to come out here, talk to the residents and so the residents can tell them... because I don't think kids are really bad, they grow onto us.

There's nothing to make them feel like they belong to the city of Boston. We have to fight so how for them. My experience in my life goes back to my three sons.

And I work for the state. And I don't want to be pushed out of Boston. And I certainly don't want to be paying all these people's high, high rent, their mortgage. I don't want to pay their mortgage. And they said, ""Oh, we got these homebuyer classes out here."" But I took three homebuyer classes, and I have a good credit score, but I still can't get a home in Boston. I mean, I can go to Brockton. I can go to Randolph. I can go all those places. But for some reason, the strings are being pulled in these homeowner classes for whom they want to be pulled. If you don't know anybody, you ain't getting nothing. Okay? And I am so sick and tired of hearing, ""Low income, low income, low income."" What do I have to do? Go out here, have three kids, to be able to get something, to get some help? You know what I'm saying? I have to go out here and don't take another promotion, because you make too much. I couldn't even get temporary housing when I'm going through my divorce. I couldn't get no shelter, because, ""You made too much."" So I had to stay with my friends and my family and continue to stay. There's nothing out here for the middle working class. Everything is you have to have a Mass Health card, which I don't have. My son happened to go to O'Bryant, but he's in Maryland. So that makes me a one single person. So for a single person out here, they don't act like we have any struggles. You know what I'm saying? They want you to pay this $3,000 rent and gas utilities. And I had a person that was supposed to be helping me telling me, ""Well, you need to get away from your life insurance."" My life insurance? Oh, shit. You must not have life insurance, because I'm not dropping my life insurance."" You know what I'm saying? It's nothing out here for the middle class. If God forbid, if you're single and you're going for a divorce or whatever, it's nothing out here. There's single people, I have come across, living in their cars. Thank God they don't have to be at the Mass Ave thing. But it's like you're giving people who want to be out here more than you're giving people who are working. There's a lot of working class people that are suffering too. And the only option is if you want anything, you have to leave the city.

I'm 23 years old, but I lived in the city for so long and I've also been born and raised here within and New York. So I was raised here and I was also raised in the Bronx, but one thing I've understood is, not all minorities are accepted in every neighborhood. We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I'm a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there's many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn't a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it's two cities in one. So it's very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I'm from Boston, I'm from the bean, I'm a Red Sox fan. I'm the official patriarch. There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions. So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we're the ones who make Boston real. We're the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That's my difficulty of understanding.

You can't eliminate struggle in the human experience and suffering, but struggle based on, to borrow from Bruce, because of how or where we were born into. Struggles as a result of all the things that divide us. What does a place look like where everybody can be? And by be, I don't mean like coexist without tension. I mean, where we can express ourselves fully and not be worried about getting food on the table and at whatever, whether you're fortunate enough to be, gainfully employed, have a career or wherever you are on the various spectrums of life, to feel whole and to have a rich spiritual and community life.

Actually right when the Long Island shelter was closed, right before the hundred inches of snow that we got that winter and I'm grateful and privileged and blessed to have gotten housing after a few months of that. But I observed like when I go over to doctor's appointments over at BMC or being around methadone bile or mass and cast, as some people call it and the situation has gotten more out in the open and it makes me sad and just disappointed to see people not housed. I know that there's some small group that like to be outside because it's hard to be in a shelter, but I don't feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don't mean just treatment, but having things like there's something called the housing first model where you don't put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, ""You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we'll fill out your verification of homelessness form."" All these things that just make it that much harder. It's harder to be sober when you're out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can't have all the solutions, it's complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I'd like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who've lived here for decades and have been here, I don't like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states.

So many veterans come return home, male and female, with a lot of issues that there should be institutions there to help people resolve their issues of what's now known as PTSD. That wasn't even a channel to turn to, if you will. Over all of our wars as this country, there been no notifications and the name has changed to protect the innocent. But at same time, you did not see the numbers of homelessness that you do now. And again, it's started in a very different time. You also had a situation under I believe, maybe Ronald Reagan, if any youngins can remember that, where the deinstitutionalization of folks who had issues not necessarily war related, but had mental health issues, spiritual issues that were in an essence turned out into the streets. Because the theme at the time is, well, we can find a place for them to come and get their medication. And they can self medicate, and blah, blah, blah, which was absolute down to Coca Cola. Now you move to a time now, where the bottom is beginning to become thicker, because of our social economic situation, Nancy spoke to and please don't misunderstand. But her position as a white person in Boston, even with that, there were prevailing kinds of situations economically, socially, that have now thickened again, the bottom of people who otherwise would not have the same worries or concerns. And how do we take that super huge problem and crystallize it and stop the life out of it, if you will, to bring it to the larger body because the body of people who are falling under that social economic state is growing. And it's including everybody, people who maybe once thought that they were safe.

I think it's Pamela that was talking about housing and how she grew up here and over the years has seen a transformation, or what we would call gentrification now. And I think it's a real need. I wasn't born here, so I don't know anything about that, but I have read so much to understand that it's a reality. And so, having spent the last, like I said, spent the last 13 years now, in Boston, I think I could, to a large extent, say I have seen it, but also I have listened to many stories. It resonates with me and I think too, to that point, is that having conversations like this and making sure that folks like Pamela, and many others who have lived here, do not leave here to go to Brockton or go to another place, it's real. And so we need to fight together. It is, whether you are new to Boston or just coming to Boston yesterday, or even arrive in Boston today, the conversation should be ongoing. I think too, and then to Kelly's point with the mental crisis, anytime I drive past the Methadone Miles I weep for this country. One, I know I'm a Nigerian, so in case you're wondering who did this, so keep talking, and I've traveled around the world to know when I see [inaudible], it baffles me that we live in a country with so much abundance and yet people are dying. It's... I just can't understand what's happening, but yet it feels like this happened in my country. It's going to be all over the world that Nigeria is blah, blah, blah. All of those African countries are black, but yet if I could take pictures and show it to my folks in Nigeria, they will laugh at me. But anyway, that's a different conversation. So I say that this is a reality, and we have to do that together, irrespective of where we come from. Whether you're old or new, it's a fight that we have to do and I think, like I said, I'm also coming from a spiritual... Today's kind of a day that the Lord has made. But I remember this, just this in regards to the Old Testament, sorry, I'm going to go a little bit fate, where the Bible talks about even those that are poor, the rich, when they go to glean their land, the Bible tells us that they allow, they don't glean everything, they allow for the poor. But we don't see that happen now. What we see is the people who claim everything and the poor doesn't have opportunity to glean behind them. And so when people go to harvest, what I'm saying is that they leave something for the poor. And what we're seeing is that the rich, [inaudible] goes grab everything is that's there. They grab as much as they could. They could even clear everything so the poor doesn't have anything on the street. And that's the result of what we see happen here. And so that's one story that resonates with me. And, like I said, I'm here. Part of the rules, it goes to tie to my own passion of seeing young people, that they don't have to live like their parents. I've got two boys and this is a fight that I have to do for them.

80,1552,2021-10-17,5245352,2645.0,2778.5,"This is Kelly. I'll go. I definitely think that what resonated was the housing, the housing and gentrification comments. I live in Beacon Hill, but don't be fooled. I live in subsidized housing and I have told people on more than one occasion, especially throughout this pandemic, that people don't know that there's a whole lot of invisible, poor people right in this very affluent neighborhood. But I think, as it relates to my questions earlier, housing is a fundamental right. It should be like... And it's a social justice issue. It's a human rights issue and if we have all of this room to build million-dollar McMansions in Dorchester and billion-dollar skyscrapers and high-rises that are sitting empty, we definitely have the ability to build more affordable housing. I saw an article yesterday that the BPDA, which is the Boston Planning and Development Association, I think, they approved something like 940 units of housing for the city of Boston. 172 of those units are listed as affordable. And affordable is a misnomer. We have way more people who are living down in... closer to the extremely low income level in this city, who cannot find housing because it is so ridiculous. But housing-affordable goes all the way up to, in some neighborhoods, $120,000 a year. That is insane. A person who is making $20,000 a year cannot compete in the same market as a person who is making $120,000 a year. And so... But both of those people would qualify for affordable housing in Boston, as it is now. And so those two things really... That really resonated for me, is the housing issue and the lack of affordable housing for people in actual brackets that represent the incomes of the people who need the housing.",dorchester,"['community trends', 'housing', 'economic opportunity', 'inequality']","['unjust', 'gentrification and displacement', 'housing affordability', 'income', 'class-based']",133.5,267.0

It's not an easy thing to go through. A lot of my experience with dealing with that situation too, is it's a dangerous situation when you go in that area. I went down to the McDonald's one day and I was, basically, accosted from the time I tried to place my order, to the window I went to pay for it, to the window I went to pick up my stuff.

My experience has been, as a community organizer, which helped transform my neighborhood and the area, I come from the Upham's Corner area. I was able to work with the businesses, and the community, and really go grassroot to the racial piece of it that really Upham's Corner struggled with, because it's very, very diverse. You had too many gangs in this neighborhood at one time, and it was their own selves. It was all these cousins and family members that were killing each other. Then, with that alone, we were having issues with the way the community looked. Who wants to come up to Upham's Corner and shop? Nobody, because of the way it looks. We needed to improve the facades, and the storefronts, and help the business with those fundings, the storefronts, and rebuild, and cameras, and safety, and things of that nature. Some things were given, like festivals and things of that nature that would bring everybody together, but that helped to camouflage how great the neighborhood was, but yet, it was lacking, because you've got one side, Jones Hill, which is a little uppity, uppity, and it's got a little more bigger houses, and a little more money. You got one side over across towards the Dudley or Quincy area, and it's folks that are just low-income and still struggling to pay the rents. Yet, we found out that a lot of the building owners that were either empty buildings, at that time, all lived in Florida. I found two of them on a golf course in Florida and was able to bring them down to a community ... I would shut down the streets where one would live at and bring the neighborhood together. We found out how diverse the neighborhood was. People from, not only from the color of their skin, but just different backgrounds from different parts of the world. That's when we got to see the richness of this neighborhood, that people just are from so many different places of the world.

And that's not fair to them when they go up against these kids who are actually being taught, and therefore they lose out on the seats, like the Boston Latin and the Boston academies. If we don't get something in gear... We don't have buildings that are adequate. They don't even have air conditioning. You've got mice in the stairwell. Kids are getting moldy lunches. And yet and still, you tell me there's a budget for school lunch, but then you're serving the kids salami. What are you doing with the money realistically? Because I know all of the money that's in budget is not being dwarfed by a sandwich of cold salami. Someone really needs to think about why everybody's pushing their kids to charter school, because no one wants their kid in a Boston public education, because it's not there. So that's key, because you can't have the next level working force of these educated kids, if they're not educated. And then you wonder why they're hanging on the corners, because a lot of times the parents get discouraged. They can't keep track of the kids. The kids feel burdened, because they see their moms struggling. And then they go and resort to things, so that they can try and help. And then they end up being profiled, and then they end up being in a system. And then you end up with all the things that are happening every day on the news. And then they look at us like we're savages, and we don't know what we're doing. But a lot of times you have kids raising kids. If you've got young kids, and then they don't have that matriarch to give them the education, to give them the knowledge that they need and the support and structure. So if the services were there, if the housing was out of the way, and they weren't worried about the landlord kicking them out or raising their rent or whatever the case, or family members having to stay with them, because they've been kicked out, we'd have less struggle there. And therefore, they could concentrate on other things and give the kids the attention, be at the parent teacher meetings, like they should be, and be involved, and be a voice in the community like they should. So if we had had a seat at the table, if we were offered more of these seats on these boards, where the decisions were being made...

So we need to hold them all accountable, especially where we live in our communities. They come in our communities, they campaign, and they promise stuff. We don't see the changes. They know what we need. It's not like they don't know what we need. I'll give you a perfect example. Mass Cass. Now, we have this city that is spreading. It's spreading almost like a disease on your skin. You know what I mean? They saw this coming. They've seen it in other cities, and they knew when there was I think 25 tents down there. They saw that. They knew it. They didn't address it. They said they knew there was a problem and they were going to create committees to explore, and they have all these different phrases and things that they use when they want to back you up off of them. So, there's over 200 now. There's a rat infestation there. The community down that way cannot continue to operate. The food pantry is down there. The big food pantry for Boston is down there. It's unsafe. You have people down there who are mentally ill. They're not responsible. So, people seen this coming. I've heard so much [inaudible] about it. Everybody has their take on it but nobody's doing anything about it. Now, and even with the ones that are running for mayor, it comes up in every conversation just about. They knew that it was there. These people didn't just fall off the chicken truck. They have been in the position to do something about that all the time. They have been in political positions, all of them, and especially these two that are running. So they knew. So when Oanh was talking about holding people accountable to their promises, we don't want to just hear you say what we want to hear at the time and get our votes. My vote is very important. I came from the generation where I heard about the stories about them closing down the polls. My mother and my aunts and uncles and all of them, it wasn't safe. They would burn down your house and kill your whole family. Lynch you in public so that it would deter the other people from stepping up and wanting to vote or wanting to be an advocate for voting.

And you listen to each individual person's experience and they share their hearts out and they share important issues that is dear to their hearts or really close to each and every single community. And, that's what motivates them to keep wanting to work with certain political candidates or political leaders, hoping to make a change. Hoping that they can hear our voices, and hoping to see things happen instead of seeing all of that is just like empty promises and the feeling of being used. And I think, at the end of the day that's the feeling that we would hate to have, is the feeling of being manipulated by someone, or being used for their own personal agenda, versus, trying to identify the real problems and coming up with real solutions. And I think that's where we can all relate. Doesn't matter what our background is.

The big thing is that all of us have our own experience with our personal story. But I think the problem was that it happen very subtle in the system. Nobody talk to nobody. They just want in their own bubble. So, it's really hard to have that across sector collaboration to ensure that would be across the board, because we know that we all have scarce resourcing and we all try to fight for the pie, but not [inaudible] and collaborate, not working together in that context. And then not really involve those who have this experience to be part of that decision making and policy revising or practices that we should be designing as a city or as the officer to be able to do that. So I think a lot of this would be... so if I should go back into the questions, whether or not... how we can hold, that Nan already mentioned, officers accountable in the work that they do? But the big thing for me in terms of how can we ensure that everything is interconnected, and how can we leverage that collaboration, partnership? And a lot of that has to come from cross work community. And I think the bigger thing would be the budget and funding. Budget and funding have not been equitably distributed across all different sectors. Some who might have more of a voice, some who might be able to speak up and speak out, those are the one who always receive the most. However, there's so many different other community day agency or faith-based agency who do the good job who really out in the community and a lot of them also doing from their heart with the husband, but the officers doesn't [inaudible].

We need everybody to be saying the same thing to these elected officials because we get it. We know we don't get the services because we don't come out and vote. And that's insane that we continue to ride our bumpy roads, that we continue that we're the last ones getting our trash dump. We can't go through the process of signing up with the City as a vendor for procurement because their process is so long and intimidating that we can't get through it. We don't have organizations that help us with our back office stuff, either be it nonprofit or whether it be a construction worker. We have a lot of construction workers, they have their own businesses, but they don't know how to do the back office stuff. They don't know how to bid on their projects.

Governor Baker doesn't even have a black person on his cabinet. So how are they representing us when he don't even have nobody like us on his cabinet. These are the things that we need to be questioning and then asking them. I asked Michelle Wu, ""Is your cabinet going to look like the people that you serve?"" Because we don't want to go backwards.

And I've been saying, ""We need to do that in state, especially Massachusetts."" We need to see what bills they're passing, which ones they're not supporting, and have a record of that, and have it where it's somewhere online or somewhere that the community could go and look at it and form their own opinions, because I think we need to stop telling people who to vote for. We need to tell them you go do your own research and find out. Don't vote for someone because Sarah said you could vote for them. I heard people say, ""Well, Sarah, don't tell them this because they'll go back and say Sarah told me to do this."" So, [inaudible]. But that's my opinion.

I still live in the same place and literally, I'm walking there to go play games at the arcade and I am now 11 at this point.

Then they just all laughed. I heard the clinking of beers and they just drove off really fast and just like, that made me think of that. So I connected briefly in that moment to that. Then just like overall, about the schooling and what you were saying earlier, Bianca, about just the really big differences in the schooling and I think a lot about how like other of my peers, who also did get held back, didn't stay. They were just like, ""All right, if I'm going to get held back, then I might as well stay home, or I'll just go to another school where they don't even take attendance."" Those are all really real things and some of those people who I'm just now mentioning, I see them, it was in the last five or six years and they were in prison, or they are imprisoned, incarcerated, or they are dead. I remember seeing the news and seeing my friend Rudy, who I knew was in foster care and stuff, he was in a shoot out with the police in like 2016 and he passed away as a result. I knew that his attendance was really bad, back in elementary school. So schooling has a huge impact on how a youth's life can turn out as an adult. Racism also, has a huge impact on how a youth can turn out as an adult. So you know, these are institutions of inequality. They were made this way for an original purpose that we could argue back and forth on for hours, but it's a matter of fact that our youth are getting harmed, in school and outside of school, on the way to playing games and stuff like that and not everybody can just tough it out and just whatever, pull them up by these imaginary bootstraps that we keep hearing about.

What are those other communities doing that's keeping it out of their communities? There's no gun manufacturers in Roxbury. There's no poppy fields in Roxbury, Dorchester.

But one of the things that I noticed is that... Well, I'll tell you why I ask that question. I believe that we need to have things that are passed down. We need some generational wealth. We need to be secure. And what we get we need to be able to keep it. We need to have something that can't be taken away from us. Like, if we get housing and we buy these houses in the community, I'm concerned about somebody coming in and offering somebody three or four times what their house is worth so that they can blockbust the community. And pretty much like Priscilla was saying with gentrification, when they want it they just come back and take it. We need some protection against that. And, the equality part of that is that it needs to be in the communities of color. Like I said, I live in what's called the West End. It's right next to North End with the Italians. Their equity is passed down through their families, their generations. They keep theirs. So, I worked at Unity Bank back in the day in the 70s and I watched money flowing through Boston. And we had opportunities then for equity. It's about education. We're not educating our young people to say, okay, we don't need those Jordan sneakers, we don't need this that and the other, we need stuff that we're going to be able to pass down to generations. We're going to leave a legacy. So, that's with my issue. That's my experience that has led me to this. I'd watched people just lose everything, and get pushed out. That's my experience.

Seeing the way that the city highlights gentrification as a positive thing, has been something that's been on my mind, just because seeing the brochures for these newer housing complexes and stuff and it's just like, ""It's like newly gentrified neighborhood"", you know what I mean? So now I'm like, [inaudible]. But you know what I mean? Yeah, connotation and context is super important, like as far as the communities go. But I definitely resonate with the stories that you both shared. Obviously, as someone who lived in Roxbury and Grove Hall, my entire life and now I'm living in the North End, because it's more affordable than where I used to live, is like that's a direct result of the ways that my community is currently and has been gentrified. I think that it's important also to recognize that for many different people, their circumstances are different. You know what I mean? We have different lived experiences and different like economic, we have different I guess ideas of economic stability and lived experiences with that, as well. So my story is like very different from a lot of other people's, but being someone who is the youngest and I never take youngest sibling, you know what I mean, like slander, because I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. But yeah, you know what I mean? Like being the youngest of a household of four children, two of whom were like adopted. It's like, kind of the idea of community that I share, or that I have and that I hold dear, is like very different than a lot of other people. I definitely think that seeing the gentrification that's taking place right now, it's very reminiscent of how the community kind of felt very disparate when I was younger, do you know what I mean? Because, you have people that you're close to, you have your kind of blood relatives and your blood family members and stuff like that. But then you also have these like adopted family members who are like, you want to care about and who are like they're a part of your family and you go to love them and stuff like that. You know what I mean? That's your brothers, your sisters. You feel me? But at the end of the day it's like, there's still always going to be a divide. You know what I mean? I feel like the people that are moving into the neighborhoods, they're not to blame for the gentrification that's taking place. It's more so around the foundations that are being laid by the city to be able to have those people move in. You know what I mean? I think that divide is something that happens a lot. I saw that happen like my own household, just like with adopted siblings and myself. You know what I mean, with my birth mom and sister, it's just like, it's easy for us to fight each other and kind of not like each other, because it's like, ""Oh you're this and this and you know whatever."" But it's not really conducive to an environment that we can all grow and thrive in. You feel me? Like there can be like space for people to be able to live in affordable housing and I mean there can be [inaudible] folks who are, you know what I mean? Like whether they're a part of the artist community or they're a part of the business community, whatever, to be able to find space. Because there shouldn't be that, like one group of people shouldn't be pushed out for another group of people to be able to thrive. You feel me? I feel like until the city has that in mind, so that concept gets through their skulls, we're not going to be able to have a clear understanding of who, of what community actually feels like.

I hadn't ever thought of it until I'll say probably the past 20 years. And again, I've been in Boston since 1970. And once I graduated high school and college and started working and having children, and I have three adult children and I have three grandchildren as well. And I've just been thinking of it lately because where I live, I live in a complex of 60 town homes, and the management company that works for us, supposedly, they're so unprofessional. They're just so... I would say slumlords if they were our landlords, but I don't call them landlords because they're a management company, but they're the worst. They're so unprofessional. They can't keep a maintenance team together for two seconds. It's just a mess. And I often think, ""If I owned my home or co-owned my home, we wouldn't have to deal with waiting for this or them coming to do this or that."" And I'll admit, I've been a section eight recipient since 1974, 1972 actually, when I moved out from my mom's home. And I've been able to maintain that, thank God, and live in Boston. Of course, the rents are just through the roof, as you all know, but home-ownership, I've been thinking about it lately, Carmen, and I have a son-in-law that he was a vet. I mean, he fought in the army and now he works for the state, and I've just been saying, ""Buy something so that we can co-own. Buy a home or have it built and build me a little, how they call it, the in-law home, or in-law unit next to it or near it. And that way you can receive the rent that I pay, the rent that the state, this year, that they pay as well."" But he's, for some reason, not wanting to do that. But just home-ownership would be so great because you have so much more of a say so in making your home as comfortable as you want it, instead of having to wait and go through the headache of people that aren't doing what they're supposed to do. So I live here right in Dorchester, and I've always thought home-ownership should be out in the suburbs somewhere. But no, I'd love to own a home right here somewhere in Dorchester, because I lived in Dorchester, Mattapan, since I've been in Boston, and I just love it. I don't always love what's going on outside of my door, but I love Dorchester, I really do. And I'd like to own a home here and the homes that they have here just cost so much. I don't foresee that happening, but I'm onboard with you, Carmen. I'd love to be a homeowner. I think we all should be homeowners if we could, but I know that's not...

I did drop something in the chat because, which anybody can read it, I've been thinking a lot about it and about all of the people who negotiate this world or this city or whatever, in more than one language, like Andry. And I find it kind of irritating that it's not celebrated because it is such an amazing accomplishment. And I've taken language classes and I keep telling people I struggle with English, but I think it's amazing and it upsets me that it is not celebrated, it is not considered one of the great benefits of Boston. So that was one way. I do own a home. I find it kind of interesting when people say, ""Oh, I never thought about owning a home,"" or anything like that because I own a home. I would not be able to buy it now, which that will be the next point, I will follow up on that. I would not be able to, like that, it's falling apart. I need help to do it, but there are some issues. I would like to say there is something called NACA, naca.com, which is a low income... Helps low income, low and middle income people buy houses. So just, people can look at that. We're smart and interestingly, we were able to buy the house way back when, under its previous incarnation, so I know about them. But going back to that kind of idea that I never thought... I know people choose to rent as opposed to buying houses, but that was always the default for me, is to buy a house. So I find that kind of interesting. And as I said, I would never be able to buy it now. I refer to this as I was kicked off the socioeconomic ladder. And I use the word kicked off very clearly. So when people start talking about accessing resources and everything like that and advertising, I didn't know that it was a big divide. And it's a communication divide. And somebody actually said to me, she said, ""My parents, my mother was a single mother on welfare."" And we were having this conversation, there's a lot to this, so nobody get offended if this comes out wrong, because it was a long conversation that went with this. And she said, ""I can't imagine what it's like for you to not even understand how to apply for these things."" I've got the college degree, I've got the whole thing like that, but it's a completely different language. And I don't think people understand how completely different the language is and the understanding is.

As I mentioned, I'm driving my family around all the time, which includes my 90-year-old father who grew up in Boston. And I've been doing a lot on Zoom, various things. So there are three parts of that that I wanted bring up in the experience. So last year I did some program at the Mass Historical Society on voting during a pandemic. And in the middle of that, one of the things in that is they talked about how James Michael Curley, if anybody's been in by Faneuil Hall, you see the statue of him, how James Michael Curley and Honey Fitzgerald, who was mayor of Boston and the grandfather of John F. Kennedy, had this real fight and they actually changed the law at that point. So James Michael Curley, who was mayor of Boston, could not have consecutive term. I thought that was hysterical. My father's a history buff and so I talked to him about that while I was driving him over to his appointment, I don't know, over there. Please don't even ask me which hospital it was at that point. And oh, and he said, ""Oh yeah, my father used to work on James Michael Curley's campaigns."" And I'm like, ""What?"" I was completely amazed. And he told me the story about my great-uncle was at a Curley rally and Curley pointed to him and said, ""You, Kid, you look cold."" And he gave him the coat off his back. And so that coat stuck around the family for years. We later found out, when I looked into this whole thing, that he actually used to keep coats in his car, so every rally he would do, he would take his coat off and give it to some kid in the group. But anyway, it turned my family into like standout campaigns and everything like that. About the same time I drove my father over to his appointment and we're coming back through Mission Hill, and he's pointing out where his grandparents had lived before they moved to Roxbury. And then he kind of muttered off his oldest brother who was kind of the black sheep of the family, he said, ""Jimmy never left Mission Hill."" So I started thinking about those things and there were a number of other things. It's like my father, when they were doing busing, the early meetings on busing, we were in the public school and the reason my parents actually took us out of the public school was because my father went to every meeting, and he kept telling people that this tract of area, that they had no houses on, the map they were living that they had was... His house was in the middle of it and he had six kids. And they kept saying, ""We'll figure it out when the time comes."" And his whole attitude was, ""Well, we're not going to figure it out. I'm going to know what to do with my kids.""",dorchester,"['institutions', 'education']","['accountability', 'processes', 'community resources', 'quality of education']",186.80000000000018,373.60000000000036

One of the other things is my father went to Roxbury Memorial for boys, which then became Boston Tech, and when Boston Tech became the O'Bryant, he moved over. Roxbury Memorial for Boys and Girls became Boston Latin Academy. And the president of his senior class is actually the last living member of Martin Luther King's fraternity.

A lot of people don't, which is a lot of the reasoning behind my advocating for people that need assistance with certain things. I think it should be advertised, the resources in Boston.

And then I left and went to another private situation because my parents were adamant they were going to keep me out of Boston. Then my children were born. I have twins, a daughter and a son. My son is somewhat challenged, so he was in special education. I lived in a town that I don't want to name right now, but to make a long story short, I had a fire. My house burned, and they kicked me son out of school three times. I had to get an education attorney, and I had to, because as long as we stayed homeless, he had stay-put rights, so I stayed homeless. In my car and families' houses, and the whole nine.

I kind of had a suspicion, but I found out, literally like two days ago, that I had an IEP growing up. I grew up working lower middle-class, so I went to the poor school in my town, in New Hampshire. Even though it was under resource, relative in that community, I still could get access to a speech pathologist. I still got access to certain supports. So when I moved to Boston, that's when I was mentioned when I went and worked at the Burke High School, it was just wild to see how under... There were really wonderful students and really committed teachers, but no relative resources. There was like four staff members that were socio emotionally supported, and they only got that because they were a turn around school. So they get money to be in turn around, to avoid going into receivership, but once they get out of turn around, they lose the extra funding. The students that were coming to school and trying to learn every day... One of the students I was working with, I found out at the very end. Like, I worked for all year and he struggled all year, coming into school, and at the end of the year, I was chatting with him. I called his family and did other things like that, and he told me. ""Mr., to be honest, I've been homeless almost the entire time."" And I'm like, ""Jesus."" That would have totally changed my approach, and I don't think a lot of the people at the school actually knew. I think they would have tried, but there was just... I think it was not a lack of will or care for these students, cause teachers and staff were amazing, it was they were students who had... Because it was a mostly Black and Brown school, so many intersecting issues that the students face, and there was just no capacity to do it. So I think that just really struck me, just thinking about myself. Like even in my town, I had challenges relative to that, but I was like, ""My life would have been so different,"" and to what folks are saying, it's material. This has material impact on people's lives. If I didn't have access to that support, I have no idea where I would be, so I think that just makes that level of building, not just education, but also ensuring that we're expanding what education means, beyond what we currently think it is. Including those soft skills, including the socio emotional skills, including... Find better words for me. Cultural incompetent, which I don't like that word. But the idea of valuing and other cultures, and recognizing that if you're working with someone, you need to value their background, so you can actually work with them in a way that's relevant to them. And I agree, that's very, very lacking. And to the same degree, a lot of students in that school and other, where I also worked at, Hyde Square Task Force in Jamaica Plain, a lot of those students, even though it's in Jamaica Plain, a lot of their families are being forced out into Brockton, or into other places, or being displaced. So it's very clear who the city, the power structures, and the White supremacist power structures in the city, are favoring, and who they think should live here. And I think that's something that's got to change, cause even if... Gentrification is not viable. If they destroy those elements of Boston's culture, the city's not going to work. We have a lot of empty luxury condos, let me tell you that. They're building up my neighborhood, all over the place, and I'm like, ""I know who you're building to live there, but no one...

Cause a lot of people say it's not very friendly and that it's very professional and too fast. I'm like, ""There's a reason for that.

There was a lull for like two or three years where it didn't seem like anyone could buy anything. You know what I'm saying? With the whole watching ... Like I said, with watching housing change where there were housing being sold, three family homes, like I live in Dorchester. For instance, living here in Dorchester versus someone who may live in Roxbury where they started talking about the word regentrification. To be on this side of how everyone had to highlight on Roxbury, I'm one of the people who living here in this community would say that Dorchester is being regentrified, and no one was paying attention to that because like I said the three family homes were being sold, but they're being sold and they're being turned into condos, and how do you turn a three family home and all of a sudden start saying that these are condo floors, and each floor now costs $360,000 versus a home, that whole home would run you $500,000. You know what I'm saying? I personally witnessed that. That's where my question comes from with the formula in pricing based of ... Where I think the housing crash happened, it took away, I think, the American dream of a hard working person owning a home and being able to own a home and say possibly use one of their floors to be their small business or like I said a second income.

They want to put them on Front Street in the prime areas where there's business owners. There's a black hotel down there. We won't even know that it's a black hotel. When it was open, we did very much go over there and have a great time, but now with the drug addiction people that are surrounding those areas who's helping those business owners to get back to the level where they deserve to get the revenue that they deserve. But because of the eyesore like where's that conversation at. And the consumerism, we can go into the cigar bars and you can go into the bars and you can do hookah, and you can do cigars.

And living there as a renter, to be as a single person with no children, I found it to be a little bit costly. And I didn't know if that was because of the renovations and the developments that's new, or if maybe it's always been like that, I never noticed. But the cost of living in Boston has gone up tremendously, especially in the last two years alone. And it is becoming more difficult for single mid adult age and young adult age youth to become more independent and have more opportunities for getting an apartment they can afford. A lot of my peers are in the bracket where they make too much to be on housing or have a subsidy, but they don't make enough to pay market rent.

I'm coming back from Syracuse, driving back to my campus and it's myself and my home girl, and we have two Black males in the backseat. It's 2:00 AM. We're going through a small town. It was 35 miles an hour. I think I was going 40. The cop trails us for an mile. And I knew he was behind me. I could see the outline of the car. So I'm slowing down, all this good stuff. He trails for a mile. After mile, he turns on his lights. Again, it's 2:00 AM, upstate New York. It's a very racial, hostile area. So I'm like, this is not going to be good. We got two Black men in the car. I mean, we're all Black. So he pulls us over, 2:00 AM. He says, ""You were driving too fast."" And of course I was already taught, given the talk, you show respect, you show difference. I'm like, sir, we were going 40. I clocked it, all that good stuff. And he's like, well, you're going 40 miles an hour. You could have hit a dog. You could have hit somebody. And I'm like, it's 2:00 AM. Right? And I'm just like, this guy. And he's like, well, let me see your license. Let me see your registration. And then he starts to say, get out of the car. And I'm like, oh God, this is not going to go well. And I'm like, officer. So then I immediately say, because everybody in that are knows the school. I'm like, ""Officer, we're just trying to get back to school. We're trying to get back to Cornell."" And he's like, ""Oh, you go to Cornell?"" Yes, sir. We all go to Cornell. We all didn't. But I was like, we got to get out of this incident. It's 2:00 AM. Nobody is out here. Getting out of the car is not going to be good. So those types of incidences and so for me, it becomes very real when people talk about issues with police and things like that. And I mean, we all saw the George Floyd incident. And even now to this day, I think about it and I get angry just thinking about it. And so it's very real. And so I hear it with the defunding, I connect to it. And at the same time, it creates, as a person, as an ally, I think that's important. But then there's also still that kind of in the back of your head, where you say, you will never understand, truly in the sense of that you will have to have the same conversations with your nieces and nephews or family members, that I have to have with mine.

And as a parent, when you talked about juggling work, school, and raising kids. That's something that not a lot of people that I know are... They don't have that knowledge of how to balance all of that together and also get a house. Usually, I mean, people in my generation, or at least or friends or my circle, they're just getting housing and trying to... If you scroll on Instagram, Facebook, it's like, ""Okay, who has the latest job? Who has the latest features or car?"" But our parents weren't worried about that, they were worried about is this the house I want? Is this is this rent good? I remember, my family was moving from... Obviously, when I was growing up, I didn't care where I lived, it was whatever it was good enough for me. But we moved from our apartment to a house. And that in and of itself, was the greatest thing for my family. It's now we have a house. And the idea of home ownership. I don't think people in the inner city understand that. You can literally, if you are a good parent, you can be looking at your children, and they won't see the suburbs or the rural areas and be like, ""I want that."" Though we see on TV, and understand that that's the life, but they won't look up to you and be like, ""We need to have a house."" But you are thinking, ""We need a house. This is what I want. I want to create generational wealth."" And that's something that I think people in my circle didn't grow up with that idea. It was just everything's here, we have an apartment, we have our household, we have education. But the idea of now getting affordable housing is something that is coming to the forefront of my mind. And how do you make sense of getting affordable housing? Where's the right place to do it? And thinking about not just getting a house but if you want to have a family, how do you now choose the right location for a school. How do you choose it, where you have good hospitals near you? And I think it's something that goes back to education, not just finances, though we need to understand how does housing happen? How do you make sure someone is held accountable if they're not hiring their friends to get this in the housing? How do you make sure everything connects and fits. And that's why I take it back to education, because if we're not just learning about 400 years of history, or the weather cyber, which is sometimes... It's important, but if we all are at the same understanding of what is going on our society, and I think you've talked about civic engagement. Voting, we don't talk about that in school at all. And it doesn't make any sense because there are so... You'll see signs of this mayor, this person for councilor, it's like, ""Who is this person?"" We're seeing these people every single day, but you don't understand your role. And I think it's also how to not only accountability for people who are in places in power, but how do we take accountability for ourselves, because we are citizens who have so much power. We have the power to vote, but not only that, we have the power to learn and make active change, to create community spaces, sit down and do it. But how do we understand our role? And it's because we're not taught at all. We're not taught that we have one.

So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system. And so that's something that since in Boston, I've been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there's a bank, somewhere, but I don't see that being implemented at all. And a big question for me is that we've been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn't been any discussions on personal. You're building these homes, you're building these spaces, we can't afford them because we can't get loans. So where's the disconnect? Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it's very predatory practices, it's just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that's one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we're having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks. And then the banks that are opened, there's no sense of community, you can't go in there, there's no one that really knows your name, no one's actually sitting there to try to figure out what they can screen you for, what products they have that would work for you. It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you're giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that's something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we're not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there? How can you usher us into a new space where we can walk into your space, and be able to say, ""I'd like a loan, please."" Actually, we don't even need to be able to ask for a loan, you should be coming to us because you go everywhere else, and you send fliers to X, Y and Z and you say, ""You're pre approved for this amount of money."" But how do we improve that line of communication and the ability for us to feel we can go to banks and be able to access the funds like we know a lot of other people can.",dorchester,"['community trends', 'institutions', 'housing', 'community life', 'education', 'economic opportunity', 'inequality']","['belonging', 'lack of action', 'expectations', 'homeownership', 'housing affordability', 'call to action', 'community relationships', 'community values', 'life skills', 'financial literacy', 'race-based', 'foreign-born']",202.19999999999982,404.39999999999964

Okay If we do get that house, how do we maintain it? If we do get that a loan, how do we maintain it? We do not get taught how to maintain what we do have, you know what I mean? And it's because we're so busy trying to obtain some things that we can't be taught. Because we're trying to hold on to the little bit we have, but if we were taught as a young age, so that goes to back to me relating with Ben, we're taught at a young age about finances, the basic life skills of learning how to cook, learning how to saw, learning how to change tires. And I learned these things in school. We had these things in school, but as the years went by, what happened? They got cut. These things got cut from the system, what just go, what's you saying? We have Boston High who who did something like what you did. There's no more Boston High. Madison is the only school that I know, vocational school right now.

We are living in a digital age now where we have access to YouTube and articles and all these other things. And so how much are we taking advantage of these critical information to help us to frame our understanding of what's happening in our communities? And so we are under 400 years of oppression where it's a constant catch up, and we haven't had an opportunity to once just usher into a space where we can finally be, but at the same time, in reverence and honor to our ancestors and folks that came before us, the tireless work that they've put out before us and becoming the first and dismantling here, mantling that, when do we take that back and prioritize it and put it at the very forefront? Because when desegregation occurred, it wasn't for us, it was to access our money. Because they knew that within a Black community, we are one of the biggest spenders. So what we had is never going to be equal because it wasn't with the intention of creating this for us to thrive and be, it was created just to give us a glimpse and make us feel we're a part when we're not. Our money is a part, our money is counted. But when it comes to proper education, and housing, and healthcare and everything else that other folks have lighter skin tones have an opportunity and access to, we are denied that.

So anyway, I spent the next 15 years trying to understand that and study it. And I have come to understand that most people who are leaders in our nation don't know the history of structural racism.

I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out. And so I became an activist when I was 14, very young. And probably at that time subconsciously leading to my adult life as an activist, I never did anything in Mission Hill.

And so I think that probably about three or four years ago, I joined the board of our neighborhood bus but before that, I still had a lot of that animosity. So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years.",dorchester,"['community trends', 'safety', 'community life', 'education', 'inequality']","['unjust', 'betrayed', 'disempowered', 'empowered', 'racialized violence', 'resident actions', 'community values', 'youth spaces', 'race-based']",138.10000000000036,276.2000000000007

And I could pull from my history something applicable. So I think I might honor all three and say a little bit about all. In terms of Cindy's experience with racism, growing up, I remember walking home from Boston Bowl and this is on the east side of Washington. And it was four of us. We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple. And then the neighbors who saw who were all white, came down to help us because they didn't feel what was happening was right which is true. And so that really tainted my view on some of the race issues, because at around the same time we were being bused as well, from Dorchester to, I was bused from Dorchester to West Roxbury- the Joyce Kilmer. So that touched my life. And then something else that really resonated with me too that's worthy of calling out is the issues that this country, the world is facing with climate change. And it's a real thing. And Boston, like this storm coming the T-stop in the South Bay has to be four to five, so that the station wouldn't get a flood with the anticipated storm coming. So it is real. There'll be more storms like this. And I'm working to get the word around about climate change. And then the third aspect is the mental health issues and challenges that we as a community face. They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater. So we have to really take a mindset of all the challenges that we have.",dorchester,"['community trends', 'public health', 'safety', 'infrastructure', 'economic opportunity']","['unjust', 'disempowered', 'mental health', 'racialized violence', 'climate impacts', 'transportation', 'income']",237.19999999999982,474.39999999999964

Sometimes it's not just about weapons. I'm going to get a little bit intimate here and share something that happened to me recently. Last winter, I was in crisis and I had lost my phone. Well, actually my phone had broke and then I had lost it. It was raining really bad that day. And I went into crisis and I was looking for a phone to use. I was near a friend's house. So I said, let me walk to this friend's house because usually they are at home, maybe I can use their phone and get a ride back to my house or whatever I got to do. So I was on my way to the friend's house and I saw the friend in that area. So I didn't even make it to their house. And I was asking them, ""Oh hey, my phone got wet in the rain. I don't have a bus pass. I need to call a ride. Can I use your phone?"" And they was like, ""Oh, my phone's off. I'm going to go pay my bill now."" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, ""Can I just walk with you or whatever?"" And they act like they didn't know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house. They said, I could wait for them at their house because they didn't know how long it was going to take. So I got a little antsy. So I knocked on a neighbor's door and they opened the door and I asked them, I said, ""Hey, I need some help. I just need to use a phone. I'm a friend of your neighbors."" And I've seen them before and they've seen me before and they just started attacking. So you can imagine how strange that was. It was a very serious altercation. It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn't home. And I was never able to use someone else's phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don't try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there's anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me.

I know that they're lots bad reasons, but I grew up in a college town in Vermont and so I had an excellent education. And I came to Boston and I was committed to having my three sons go through the Boston Public School system, which they did. They graduated. They went all the way. But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp. And so she was really tough on them and the parents all complained the kids are getting ulcers, they are having nightmares and everything. Like it was really hard for the kids and because of that, one of my sons went to this school, one of my sons went to that school. I imagine their capabilities are comparable but I can see how it happens that because of a small difference, one goes this way and one goes that way.

After having a house, well, it was his daughter, my mother, who actually received the house after he passed away, but she was gentrified out because it became unaffordable for her to live there, because of taxes. Now it's a multimillion dollar home, on the corner of Stromard and Massachusetts Avenue. As I said, five generations of Rocks have lived over and impacted in that house, and unfortunately, it's gone now. That's the, I think, the collective experience of Black folks in Boston, being pushed out from one neighborhood to another. The impact is great, it's an emotional strain. In many ways, I'm not sure about this whole issue about a conversation. I think it's overstated, about conversations. Because we've been having conversations for years, about gentrification. In fact, Collins and Kevin White and others, already had a master plan for Boston, and that has been in the making for, now, close to 100 years. So when people say, ""Let's have a conversation,"" have a conversation with who? There was a group back... And I know all of you all can relate to this, is that there was a group back in the day, called The Vault, and The Vault made the decisions, regarding what happened; politically, economically, socially, morally, and everything else, in the City of Boston. And The Vault still exists today.",dorchester,"['housing', 'inequality']","['gentrification and displacement', 'race-based']",173.70000000000027,347.40000000000055

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",dorchester,"['education', 'inequality']","['quality of education', 'race-based', 'class-based']",157.79999999999973,315.59999999999945

I just read, in the Boston Globe yesterday, that Black teachers hardly exist in Boston anymore. So all that work that Judge [Garrity] did, to actually call for a one on one hiring, and to bring up the level of Black teachers, to be at the same level of the population of students, which was at the time around 23, 24%, everything has changed and nothing has changed in Boston, in terms of educational opportunity for Black folks.

So I think they should figure out a way, I don't know, maybe make a new road or something to help the traffic in that area. So yeah, I feel that's a pretty big problem right now, at least in East Boston. I don't know about other parts of Boston. So you feel that if there's less construction, it would equal less traffic or how does that impact you? Are you a driver? Are you a commuter? How is traffic impacting you in your own personal day? I would say in the train, a lot of the times I've noticed that now there's way more delays on the blue line. That's also the same line that's connected to the airport. So it might have to do with that too. Because you always got people coming in and out, that are leaving the airport or going to the airport. But I've also noticed that the trains are now way more packed than what they used to be.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth. So I speak from my experience, because I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with Arne Duncan, who is the former Secretary of Education. And this was a meeting where students from all across the country, we sat down, we talked with him. And we just got to talk, what is our education system looking like? And I'm from Boston, Harvard's down the sheet, Wentworth, MIT, all these schools. But in my mind, and I'm actually talking with the kids that I work with now, they're juniors and seniors [inaudible] O' Bryant School. And they're like, they read these books that like, ""The next day, we don't remember what we read."" And it's interesting because I think that when I actually talked with Arnie Duncan, I told him straight up, I was like, ""You look like you're really outstanding man. So why is it that we don't have classes on financing? Why can't we teach cooking class? Why can we teach home economic classes? Why can we not teach our youth how to make a garden? How to cook for yourself? How to buy a car? How to do these things? Why does our family members have to do this on our own and teach and teach us when."" I feel it makes sense in education system, we should be learning that specific fact. I mean, the weather cycle is great and all, but teach the foundations of life first and then you can proceed to electives as in like, language and... I mean, language is of course important but teach stuff on first. And it's interesting because I think that that's something education is once we're going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum. But I think that it's important to start teaching, especially Black and Brown youth, we shouldn't wait until you're in your 20s to start learning about finance.

So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that's being funded by the taxpayers, that's being built by the city, and all these different things, and it's just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately.

And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made.

So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience. You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers.

So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents.

So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system. And so that was one reason why I think that it never got on track because of the results. When I see that happening again, I see the same ideas about trying to open up the classroom and trying to not have grades and trying to design schools that try to meet the students where they are and just going through the same cycle.

How are you going to treat our neighborhood if I decide to let you in to my network of people to talk to them to figure out what they want? What is the end result? How are you going to represent us statistically? How are you going to talk about us in a way that highlights and celebrates all of our diversity?"" Which you were talking about Somala, which is something that I always talk about. And then, the other thing that we, well, I always think about is that the leadership comes in different forms and this is something that Jasmine said, and why is it that people are always looking for leadership to look a certain way? Leadership looks so different with so many different people in our neighborhoods. I often wonder about the youth in our neighborhood, everybody's looking for the shiny, bright youth in our neighborhood. What about the youth that are struggling? They could be shiny and bright too. Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I'm sorry my memory's a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they've chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she's at school, ""Everybody I'm just going into the Military."" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don't see too many Latinas in the field that she's in. She's in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways.

Where we can say, ""This is proven to be done and we need these people back again."" I just think that there should be more say. A lot of people should have a better say, more voice around what they want to see in their community. But we have to preserve the legacy and also bring that back into the educational system, which will hopefully amplify the historical landmarks that we have, so they can't be erased. I want to advocate for that more. I think there's a lot of neighborhood legacy. I want to advocate for that, just try to make that something before it just disappears, and it's not the same anymore.

I am smart enough to have my own services from outside but you would think that this would be a priority to them because I have students from that school who still come here every day and tell me, on the first day of school, this kid came into my home and said to me, ""I don't want to go to school."" And I was confused. And I said, ""Well, why don't you want to go to school?"" And he said, ""Because I don't want to."" And I said, ""But why?"" I said, ""You have to finish for our team."" And he said, ""It's just not the same. I can't go there. I don't want to be there."" I have another kid who just came up from Alabama and she came over and she said, ""I can't be in the school. No one will help me."" I have his girlfriend who cries every day. They're not helping us. And it's like they just want to, okay, the person passed and they just want to erase all the memories like this person was never ever there. Let's just not talk about him. Let's not recognize him. He was never there. And that's wrong. That's foul. The people left behind are always there and so much pain which is why we need experts. People who are trained to deal with grief. It is very, very difficult to understand what it, adults don't understand it. You're unable to explain it to young people. If you don't understand it, you can't explain it to them and so they struggle as you are struggling. And so everybody is walking around blind and struggling and nobody's getting help and it's a very difficult, complicated situation and it's ongoing. It goes on for months and years which is what folks fail to realize. I've had someone say to my son, oh, you're still... I'm paraphrasing. I can't remember the exact words, but it was still painful. You're still grieving your father or something like that, years later. For some people, it never ends. It never ends. They learn to live with it but there's always a problem. There's always a part of their lives that just doesn't seem to fit and it's very difficult and I am so sorry Keemysvoice for your loss.

Firstly, I am a homeowner through one of Boston's programs that help to give affordable homeownership, but I believe like there are some loopholes that stifle our people. When you go through this process, it doesn't allow for advancement. What? It doesn't allow for advancement, they don't have any resources for the homeowners after the purchase, any guidance. And then, as Dorothy had said, they tend to... When you come up with an issue with the house and the quick build of that, money rules the factor of giving these contractors the job to do something, and then they use cheap materials and product. And I don't know if the inspection process part of it is skipped over just to get pushed along just to get the home sold. And then the City's not tentative to the homeowners when they get into a serious situation. And then the reason why you go through that is because of, like what Tarazer said, the pricing, the pay that you make. Half a million dollars for a property that's probably not equal to a half a million dollars' worth of property. And also to piggyback is: are they trying to do what they did in the '60s and move the colored people back onto the outskirts so it's comfortable for the upper class, so to speak, people to be able to access their jobs more easily and make things convenient? It's okay that we share, but be fair. So, don't just push us all out or whatever after we've built up the community and the livelihood of all the neighborhoods and brought that equity back, and now you slyly just push the minority population of the Dorchester Roxbury Mattapan communities out. And I hope that those fears don't come into the homeowners and they stay with their properties, because there's people that come out here like, ""We'll buy your house for X, Y, Z."" And the money sounds enticing to the homeowners that are minority and don't have much, but they need to stand their ground and stay in these properties and have something to pass on to their children or their family afterwards.",dorchester,"['community trends', 'housing', 'economic opportunity']","['frustrated', 'belonging', 'manipulated', 'homeownership', 'gentrification and displacement', 'housing quality', 'jobs']",199.29999999999995,398.5999999999999

So over the years support groups, which you're suggesting, what you're recommending, support groups in any way, shape or form, however you can create them. Support groups, they serve a purpose. So stating that and recommending that, that's a big help. That can be a big help to a lot of people because some people feel as though others don't hear them even when they speak. So when they're in a situation where others are willing to listen, and not just listen, but hear them, that is very helpful for people who are hurting. Well I'm willing to be a part of a support group if anyone wants to start one. That's nice. You know, what I will do is I'm going to send a link around, I don't know if you're familiar with Can We Talk Dorchester, and it's a group again, that you can share your emotions and different things and it came out of a family's pain where their son, who everybody also loved and was very fond of just like Keemysvoice's son, he was murdered and it shocked a community.

So I will send that information out and if you want to join in that group, even if you don't say anything but listen to fill it out, to see if that might be a space for you, because sometimes there is things or there are things that are on your chest that you want to get off and there are a number of things because not only the death of someone can cause a depression but also that housing situation, also the loss of feeling like you have this open space that the serenity and all of these quality of life issues are going away can cause deep depression and which are also part of the mental health piece.

Every month, it looks like they're just building something new. And the traffic here has gone up by a lot. A couple years ago, it might have been a little bit bad, but now it's pretty bad. Especially in the mornings, when a lot of people that bought all these new apartments here, they usually go work in the city. So the tunnels, it's crazy, man. It's jam packed in the morning. So I think they should figure out a way, I don't know, maybe make a new road or something to help the traffic in that area. So yeah, I feel that's a pretty big problem right now, at least in East Boston. I don't know about other parts of Boston. So you feel that if there's less construction, it would equal less traffic or how does that impact you? Are you a driver? Are you a commuter? How is traffic impacting you in your own personal day? I would say in the train, a lot of the times I've noticed that now there's way more delays on the blue line. That's also the same line that's connected to the airport. So it might have to do with that too. Because you always got people coming in and out, that are leaving the airport or going to the airport.

I really want to hear from your point of view, what is different from you, living in Indiana and then coming here, is there more houses there that you can buy? Do we have more houses here that you can... Give us a little bit more about that. I'll say, because when we initially moved here, we stayed in a graduate housing at Harvard, because that's where my wife is going to school.

As I was listening to everybody, I always asked the question of whoever's coming into my neighborhood, whether it's my neighborhood or my neighboring neighborhood, ""What are you going to do for us in our neighborhood? How are you going to treat our neighborhood if I decide to let you in to my network of people to talk to them to figure out what they want? What is the end result? How are you going to represent us statistically? How are you going to talk about us in a way that highlights and celebrates all of our diversity?"" Which you were talking about Somala, which is something that I always talk about. And then, the other thing that we, well, I always think about is that the leadership comes in different forms and this is something that Jasmine said, and why is it that people are always looking for leadership to look a certain way? Leadership looks so different with so many different people in our neighborhoods. I often wonder about the youth in our neighborhood, everybody's looking for the shiny, bright youth in our neighborhood. What about the youth that are struggling? They could be shiny and bright too. Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I'm sorry my memory's a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they've chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she's at school, ""Everybody I'm just going into the Military."" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don't see too many Latinas in the field that she's in. She's in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways. So I'm just all over the place because I agree with everything everybody said. And I have an accent but you only hear it when I'm angry and you only hear the southern part.

In both Somerville, most recently, but also in San Francisco, where I'm originally from, I have just seen... Some people, I think, might call it gentrification, but what I actually experienced is just the flavor going away. I mean, actually, quite literally, flavor. My mom grew up in the Mission District in San Francisco, which is heavily Latin X, heavily Mexican, and bit by bit, the places that we used to go for things, certain foods, my favorite burrito place, my favorite spot for different desserts and things like, that's gone. It literally just disappears, and so [inaudible]... That's just one example, in San Francisco. I would say the same thing about Somerville. I lived, for some time, outside of Union Square.

Different kinds of flavor, and you could walk into these spaces and get that kind of flavor, that kind of culture, that kind of... All those things that come along with food. And you could walk in there... I've actually recently visited, and it's not the same. It's not that kind of thing that it used to be, when I lived out there for 12 years. And I'm starting to see that in Boston as well. I'm starting to see, I think, on a negative front, a lot of places getting pushed out farther and farther. You're starting to see places go into Malden and Quincy, and that's cool. I'm glad that places are still existing, but those places, some of them used to be in Boston. On the more positive front, I'm also starting to see some new spaces coming up, like 50 Kitchen, in Dorchester, that's a pretty awesome spot. There's a couple real cool spots out in... I mentioned Somerville, but I know my friend Elliot has a restaurant called Tanam, that's out near Bow Street Market, so there's these little gems that I'm starting to see, but not as fast as these other places are going away.

I kind of had a suspicion, but I found out, literally like two days ago, that I had an IEP growing up. I grew up working lower middle-class, so I went to the poor school in my town, in New Hampshire. Even though it was under resource, relative in that community, I still could get access to a speech pathologist. I still got access to certain supports. So when I moved to Boston, that's when I was mentioned when I went and worked at the Burke High School, it was just wild to see how under... There were really wonderful students and really committed teachers, but no relative resources. There was like four staff members that were socio emotionally supported, and they only got that because they were a turn around school. So they get money to be in turn around, to avoid going into receivership, but once they get out of turn around, they lose the extra funding. The students that were coming to school and trying to learn every day... One of the students I was working with, I found out at the very end. Like, I worked for all year and he struggled all year, coming into school, and at the end of the year, I was chatting with him. I called his family and did other things like that, and he told me. ""Mr., to be honest, I've been homeless almost the entire time."" And I'm like, ""Jesus."" That would have totally changed my approach, and I don't think a lot of the people at the school actually knew. I think they would have tried, but there was just... I think it was not a lack of will or care for these students, cause teachers and staff were amazing, it was they were students who had... Because it was a mostly Black and Brown school, so many intersecting issues that the students face, and there was just no capacity to do it. So I think that just really struck me, just thinking about myself. Like even in my town, I had challenges relative to that, but I was like, ""My life would have been so different,"" and to what folks are saying, it's material. This has material impact on people's lives. If I didn't have access to that support, I have no idea where I would be, so I think that just makes that level of building, not just education, but also ensuring that we're expanding what education means, beyond what we currently think it is. Including those soft skills, including the socio emotional skills, including... Find better words for me. Cultural incompetent, which I don't like that word. But the idea of valuing and other cultures, and recognizing that if you're working with someone, you need to value their background, so you can actually work with them in a way that's relevant to them. And I agree, that's very, very lacking. And to the same degree, a lot of students in that school and other, where I also worked at, Hyde Square Task Force in Jamaica Plain, a lot of those students, even though it's in Jamaica Plain, a lot of their families are being forced out into Brockton, or into other places, or being displaced. So it's very clear who the city, the power structures, and the White supremacist power structures in the city, are favoring, and who they think should live here. And I think that's something that's got to change, cause even if... Gentrification is not viable. If they destroy those elements of Boston's culture, the city's not going to work. We have a lot of empty luxury condos, let me tell you that. They're building up my neighborhood, all over the place, and I'm like, ""I know who you're building to live there, but no one... "" It's just bonkers to me, to be destroying what actually has kept Boston. Like what has made it a place that people can actually live and want to go to. Cause a lot of people say it's not very friendly and that it's very professional and too fast. I'm like, ""There's a reason for that.

My son is somewhat challenged, so he was in special education. I lived in a town that I don't want to name right now, but to make a long story short, I had a fire. My house burned, and they kicked me son out of school three times. I had to get an education attorney, and I had to, because as long as we stayed homeless, he had stay-put rights, so I stayed homeless. In my car and families' houses, and the whole nine. That's my next book. To keep my son in his special education program, because he was in middle school, and it was a pivotal time. I did not want him in Boston, however the town had a detective following us around. And the detective came to the hearing at the Department of Education and gave sworn testimony, which was a lie, a humongous lie, and so we lost our case. He got kicked out of the town, and ended up in Boston. Then I had to eat that, because Boston kept him back, and I wasn't happy with that. So yes, I have a story, I have some wounds, and I would like to know that for the future, education is going to be better. I think trades need to brought back, everybody can't handle college. College isn't the answer like we've been duped to believe. It's gotten us debt, so that's my contribution. I would like to know and think that the future generations are going to have a better education, better opportunity, for public educational, in a non-traditional way, and cost effective.",east boston,"['housing', 'education']","['housing instability', 'higher education', 'quality of education']",146.5,293.0

That that's all well and good, but this is a city, and I would say as people living in the city, you have to be cautious. There are some people in the city that are not well. There are some people that involve themselves in things, and it takes awhile. Sometimes suddenly you're listening to the opinions and the ideas of other people, and they're just not... you just, just work on yourself. Go inward, work on yourself, work on your intuition. And if your gut, always go with your gut, if your gut tells you, ""Wait a minute, that didn't sound right. That person didn't sound like they were really supportive of my ideas."" And what I found is, any idea you have that comes from within you, any goal that you set as something that you want to do, you don't let anybody else interfere with that. When people come home, have opinions and want to interfere, you sometimes have to cast that aside, because everyone's different. And we all have an innate ability to preserve ourselves and to reach our goals, especially if those goals are toward the betterment of humanity and the betterment of ourselves, and the betterment of pretty much the universe.

I'm currently in a community service club here at Northeastern, and one of the things that we did was a culture walk. So we were able to walk around all the different communities and neighborhoods that surround Northeastern, like Roxbury and Dorchester. And we went through all different communities of Boston that I've personally not been to before. And something that was kind of eye opening to me was that I didn't, since I've never been to them before, I didn't really know that they were there. And it was kind of like a very reflective experience because I was wondering why I haven't been to those communities before and why this club that I was participating in thought we would benefit from these walks. And I realized that it is so important to familiarize yourself with the communities that surround you. Especially since the Northeastern campus is kind of, it can be kind of isolating if you don't walk beyond the borders of it, it can feel like its own little isolated place where everything is all students, and all... this one type of community and culture and academic rigor. But you walk just like 10 minutes outside of the campus lines and there's a whole different community and culture at play. So that was something that was very eye-opening to me. And I think that's why I came to that question, because even though I did engage in those neighborhood and community walks, I still want to learn more about it. And I still want to be confident in my familiarity with those communities. And I want to be able to hopefully one day see myself as a part of that community too.

When I came to this country, not from another state, but from another country, you feel alone. There are not many people like you from your country who speak your language. But if you start in the city where you live, there are social centers, for example, community centers, the school where your kids go, they have potlucks, they have open houses. So you start going to this event and you make friends with the parents and you start going to all the events at the schools, especially if you are... you like to be involved in your kid's school, you go to the event, you talk to the teachers and then little by little, you see that people are not really different. We come from different places, but I think we all share the same goals. We... as a mother, in fact, you meet with mothers and they all want what's good for their kids. They want their kids to go, to be good at school, to be involved in afterschool programs. So because of that, you start making friends and the friends are not always, and not in my case, they were never from my countries. They were people who came to the United States or people from Boston. And then you start, this friendship would last forever. I'm still friend with parents whose kids went to with my sons when they were in elementary school. My kid is in college now. And I still, when I see them in the street, we stop and we talk, and we talk about what our kids are doing, how when they grew up, they are not with us anymore. But I think what EL is doing is great.

Y yo me pregunto: ""Boston es una ciudad que tiene un sinfín de servicios, hospitales, universidades, es una ciudad turística; es una ciudad que tiene un montón de componentes que la hace interesante para vivir y para el turista. Pero ¿adónde cree la ciudad de Boston que va a encontrar mano de obra o la fuerza pujante, que somos la comunidad inmigrante, para tener todas estas escuelas, hospitales o restaurantes en pie? Porque, independientemente que nos movamos para ciudades más lejos o más cómodas, las distancias son grandes y se dificultará esta clase que no podemos pagar una renta, venir a trabajar a Boston. ¿Y por qué le digo esto? Por mi experiencia, yo tengo 20 años viviendo en Boston y en los últimos años para mí ha sido un esfuerzo sobrehumano pagar la renta. Y moverme no es una opción en este momento, porque mi hija depende de una beca, que tiene que vivir en Boston, yo he comenzado un trabajo en la ciudad de Boston. Entonces, moverme de Boston a mí me limita y me quita un montón de oportunidades, pero a la vez, vivir en Boston, con esta crisis que hay de vivienda, me dificulta otras cosas. Entonces, ¿hacia dónde se ve Boston? Se ve sin una fuerza trabajadora como la comunidad inmigrante en un par de futuros con esta gran crisis de vivienda que hay. ¿Qué piensan las autoridades de Boston sobre la crisis de vivienda? Porque todo el mundo se pronuncia, pero el latino a veces cree la gente que va a sobrevivir y no. Hay gente que ahora tiene dos, tres trabajos para pagar la renta. Y no es que estemos pidiendo que nos den nada regalado, no, a nosotros no nos gusta que nos regalen las cosas. Pero sí creo que no se han puesto a pensar que hay una clase trabajadora que no va a poder seguir viviendo en Boston. Y que se oye bonito cuando dicen: ""No, vamos a hacer el control de renta, la vivienda es un problema"". Pero nadie ha hecho nada realmente como para pararla.

Because we have a toddler, and we'll have another toddler in our home shortly. And they don't want to rent to us because of the Lead law compliance, which is not fair renting practices.

One of the most prominent high schools in the city of Boston throughout the country, the first public school ... In the seventh grade, I was accepted in Boston Latin. I did not want to go there, but my mother made me go there. But during my tenure there in the seventh grade, I was called the N-word by a teacher. So I continued to fight for the freedom, the liberation of black boys and black men. I have a 21-year-old son. Every time I look at the news, I'm afraid of the young people I've helped, the brothers I see. When I opened up, I said I'm emotionally, spiritually in that zone, trying to deal with life. I lost a friend, I'm speaking at his funeral tomorrow, who happens to be connected to an elected official, our mayor. I fought to help black men with an effort to form a commission that was denied.

We get to the level that we can see where the backgrounds, or the people who are there, and how they got to that place that they are now. It'll give some indication of the inequities in Boston. And I think that is what I feel is very much needed right now, a measuring tool to get some indication of where these inequities started, whether it be educational lack. Young lady earlier talked about gentrification. Gentrification is happening all over the world, but it's particularly true in Boston for some good reasons. And we need to measure those reasons and we need to speak honestly about those reasons. This mayoral election is helping to open that up a little bit, but not to the extent that it needs to be. I give a lot of credit to the mayor, Kim Janey, for tackling this issue, but I think it needs to be delved into a lot deeper in terms of the causes of this crisis at Mass and Cass.

So when they're in a situation where others are willing to listen, and not just listen, but hear them, that is very helpful for people who are hurting.

They started this group out of there, but now they have a Can We Talk group that is out of second church in Codman Square. And Emmanuel Temples outreach actually facilitates it. It's every Tuesday. So I will send that information out and if you want to join in that group, even if you don't say anything but listen to fill it out, to see if that might be a space for you, because sometimes there is things or there are things that are on your chest that you want to get off and there are a number of things because not only the death of someone can cause a depression but also that housing situation, also the loss of feeling like you have this open space that the serenity and all of these quality of life issues are going away can cause deep depression and which are also part of the mental health piece.

Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I'm sorry my memory's a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they've chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she's at school, ""Everybody I'm just going into the Military."" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don't see too many Latinas in the field that she's in. She's in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways. So I'm just all over the place because I agree with everything everybody said. And I have an accent but you only hear it when I'm angry and you only hear the southern part. You don't really hear the Puerto Rican side until I'm really, really upset.

But, no doubt what Joe said, racism is everywhere. Even though I'm a transplant, I first came to Boston when I was really young, and one of my first experience of Boston was the whole Charles Stuart case, and I think that's another reason why, in addition to Boston, the Charles Stuart case, it created this whole I guess stereotype of Boston being a racist city.

At one time he was hospitalized and it continues. What people don't understand is that grief doesn't have a deadline. The way one person deals with grief is different from the way another. Some people are just thrown off and they never recover. That's difficult to believe but they never do. They never do. And the start of my son's issues and problems was because he lost his father. He was very close to his father. I used to say to my brother that he loved his father more than he loved me. I didn't regret that I didn't have a problem with it but just to give you a sense of the relationship. And so from the time, the way my son responds to his father's passing, I always describe it as though a hole in the world opened up and he fell in because nothing was the same after that. I can give you, oh my gosh, a book of the things that went wrong. So when it comes to grief and mental health and needing help, it is not a week long thing. It cannot be. It has to be ongoing and there has to be experts who recognize the severity, the gravity of the situation. They have to have a safe space which many young people don't.

And like her, I'm very sensitive to the increase noise that we're hearing in Boston and specifically those lanes that were recently created for the bicycles, they have decreased the number of lanes that were previously there in a number of major routes. And because of that, people are much more irritated and frustrated and the honk and the phones and so on. And also too because it cuts down on the efficiency of getting from point A to point B in Boston because you're backed up now. So I think the noise level has increased due to the, I don't know who made the decision about where to decrease those lanes, but it's an annoyance and it's an irritant and it's causing a lot of noise pollution. So when, Mish I think you even talked about serenity and peace and whatever, it brought me to that, that we have increased the amount of noise due to people's irritation and frustration with those lanes. So I don't know if I'm doing a disservice to the people who are bicyclists. But I think that whoever made the decision could have done a better job in finding the routes that they needed to to amend with these bicycles. Some of those roads weren't built for that, and some of the residents in those areas have been complaining. One woman told me in order to get around the corner to a store that she frequented in the past, now it takes two times, three times as long to get there because now there's only one lane versus two that were available in the past.

I was, as I mentioned before, the guns, I work a later shift and I get home sometimes after nine o'clock and when I get home after nine o'clock, I'm concerned with nothing other than coming down from the T station. I'm glad the commuter rail is just right up the street from where I live because I take the commuter rail. I no longer take the red line or the buses. I'll get on the commuter rail, go into work, go into the office. I'm so concerned when I get out of the office because I work at the C point area which is very safe. There's always tons of people walking around. There's the long wharf and then there's the international, Intercontinental, I'm sorry, Hotel so there's always a bunch of tourists around. There's always transit police and police because it's the downtown area so I'm not concerned so much walking from my office when it's dark at night, ask the eight o'clock to south station. But sometimes when I arrived Blue Hill Labs Station where I get off, there's a big old long platform and a big old long ramp. So what I did was I was, because sometimes people are just sitting there. I don't know, maybe, watching trains but it's late at night, they're just sitting there guys. So what I did was I asked the engineer, I said, ""Look, when you get to Blue Hill Avenue, could you possibly pull closest possible to that ramp?"" And he said, ""You ain't going towards the rebuilt area?"" And I said, ""Yes."" He said, ""Yeah."" He said, ""That's a long platform."" I said, ""Yes it is."" And he said, ""That's a long ramp."" And I said, ""I'm glad you know that."" He said, ""I never know where to stop because some people do when they exit the train, they go towards the Blue Hill Lab but I go towards Cummins Highway because I live on that side."" And most people it's maybe one or two people they will get off. Me and another woman or me and another guy but there's never more than two or three people that will get off at that stop. So he started pulling close as possible, going towards [inaudible] so I don't have to walk up the long platform to get to the ramp and then walk up the ramp. The ramp is so long, I don't know if anyone has ever taken the commuter rail or has entered that station, but they have benches that you could rest because it's so long. So lately there's been some crazy guys sitting on those benches with their mask on and stuff like and it's kind of scary too. You never know if someone's waiting there, they going to knock you upside your head or when you exit out of the station on Cummins Highway, they're doing construction up there so it's always kind of dark. The trucks and stuff are everywhere. When I'm crossing the street I'm always feeling nervous because those bike racks are in the way and then it's so dark that if you're walking across, the cars may not be able to see you and you don't know who may be they're waiting with a gun or whatever. I always think about the guys that were shot a few years ago at that barbecue. They're sitting in a car or outside of our car and then the grandmother that was just sitting on her porch and some random shooting or something like that. Where do these...

And that's not fair to them when they go up against these kids who are actually being taught, and therefore they lose out on the seats, like the Boston Latin and the Boston academies. If we don't get something in gear... We don't have buildings that are adequate. They don't even have air conditioning. You've got mice in the stairwell. Kids are getting moldy lunches. And yet and still, you tell me there's a budget for school lunch, but then you're serving the kids salami. What are you doing with the money realistically? Because I know all of the money that's in budget is not being dwarfed by a sandwich of cold salami. Someone really needs to think about why everybody's pushing their kids to charter school, because no one wants their kid in a Boston public education, because it's not there. So that's key, because you can't have the next level working force of these educated kids, if they're not educated. And then you wonder why they're hanging on the corners, because a lot of times the parents get discouraged. They can't keep track of the kids. The kids feel burdened, because they see their moms struggling. And then they go and resort to things, so that they can try and help. And then they end up being profiled, and then they end up being in a system. And then you end up with all the things that are happening every day on the news. And then they look at us like we're savages, and we don't know what we're doing. But a lot of times you have kids raising kids. If you've got young kids, and then they don't have that matriarch to give them the education, to give them the knowledge that they need and the support and structure. So if the services were there, if the housing was out of the way, and they weren't worried about the landlord kicking them out or raising their rent or whatever the case, or family members having to stay with them, because they've been kicked out, we'd have less struggle there. And therefore, they could concentrate on other things and give the kids the attention, be at the parent teacher meetings, like they should be, and be involved, and be a voice in the community like they should. So if we had had a seat at the table, if we were offered more of these seats on these boards, where the decisions were being made...

Do we have more houses here that you can... Give us a little bit more about that.

I know that they're lots bad reasons, but I grew up in a college town in Vermont and so I had an excellent education.

But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp. And so she was really tough on them and the parents all complained the kids are getting ulcers, they are having nightmares and everything. Like it was really hard for the kids and because of that, one of my sons went to this school, one of my sons went to that school. I imagine their capabilities are comparable but I can see how it happens that because of a small difference, one goes this way and one goes that way. And certainly when there are much bigger differences, including the color of your skin and the way you speak and how much your parents were able to invest in your education, I mean, reading you stories when you were an infant or even in the womb or whatever.

Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts?

So my experiences are very different, but I know being one of five kids who went to that school, who were actually from Boston, that it's not easy. The experiences I had going to that school really molded me because it's kind of like I had an inside view into what private schools are like and what kids who have the resources from their parents and just their communities look at what they have to do versus us who have to pretty much prove ourselves constantly and fight for everything that we want to be able to stay within the conversation.

So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience.

There were times that folks, whoever would pull the fire alarm and the white kids and the black kids, 1976, I would come out and it would be a riot. I would have to go back into a school full of white kids that fought my friends. So the busing ever ... We've talked about racism, we've talked about our experiences and our story, but that just brought me back and it was a trigger for me because you can't put a bandaid on racism because it's like putting salt in the wound.

And it's complicated like someone said, the world is so divided, but at the same time, we do need to be more, I agree with being more involved in the kids' schools because you don't know what's going on over there. My son is five years old and I went to the school. They had a meeting with me, because he has autism. He was pulling his pants down and urinating on the floor. So, I'm like, ""Okay, that doesn't sound right, because when he's at home he is not doing it, he goes to the bathroom and he wears underwear.""

And they were all like, ""He needs to be in underwear since he wears underwear at home, he should be in underwear at school."" I was like, ""I don't think that's a good idea."" Because, I think it's too fast. He is not familiar with his surroundings yet, he doesn't know. But people don't think that we know our children and that we don't know what's best for them, because they have degrees and these things and that they know better than we do, but if we've been with our children ever since they've been born. We know our child more than anyone else can think that they know them. So, I did what they said and I put him in underwear and I sent him to the school. And I set my son up for failure, because then he's in an uncomfortable situation. He doesn't know if this is comfortable for him or not. So, he ended up pulling his pants down and stuff. So, then they ended up wanting to have a meeting with me. So, I ended up having the meeting with them. And then I'm like, ""Let me see what this bathroom looks like, let me see."" Because, my son has a problem with using public restroom, so I go in the bathroom and I walk into the classroom and the classroom is so depressing. As soon as I went in the class, it was a whole depression came over me or something. It was dark in the class. I forgot where I was at. And I'm like, ""Damn, open up some of the windows, the shades and stuff, why is it so dark in here?"" And so I walked into the bathroom to see if he'll go and the bathroom was so dark and scary. It looked like it was a dungeon or something. I'm like, ""No wonder why these kids is in here acting up, they're in a developmental class and it's depressing as hell in here. Come on. No wonder why they're acting up. Open up the damn shades. Put the light on in the bathroom. God said let there be light, come on. Get it together in here."" I'm like, ""Oh my god, I didn't even know."" I felt something as soon as I went in there and I was uncomfortable. And I didn't like that so I took my son home for the day, because as soon as I went back in the room to talk with the teacher and then they said my son was knocking shelves off of the wall. So, I'm like, ""Yeah, you're going home for the rest of the day."" They were trying to kick him out of school.

And we're just at these moments now, where it's like these are things that we have to be concerned about.

I guess they're trying to do privacy and stuff, but 12 years old, there ain't no privacy. When I was 12, I didn't have no privacy, when I was 12, I couldn't go to the doctors and tell the doctors whatever I wanted to tell them and tell my grandmother to sit out in the waiting room. That wasn't happening. So, I feel like us as parents and grandparents, we have to get back to our roots, because when children were raised the way I was raised, I didn't like being told what to do and stuff and like that, but it made me who I am today and that made me a great person, because I had structure. My grandmother played out with us. We would get in trouble for stuff. Discipline was very popular in our household. And now it's like people are telling the people they can't discipline the children anymore. That's making the kids feel like they've got the power. Growing up I didn't have no power. My grandmother told us something and that was it. And then moving forward to the housing, there's no rent control. Every year my rent is going up and I don't understand that, because it just doesn't make sense to me. The people can just keep raising the rent, raising the rent, housing authorities telling you, ""Oh, there's nothing we can do, we're only going to pay you this amount. Or you're going to have to find somewhere else to live."" And then it's like trying to find somewhere else to live is like pulling teeth out of somebody's head with no Novocaine.

When a developer comes in and wants to develop on public land owned by the city, and they want federal or state, or city tax credits, you don't get them unless we come up with a plan to make sure that there's packages of housing, for one, two, three, four, five room housing.""

And so, our agenda has to be able to come... Either one of them is going to be the mayor, and so I think the whole thing around gentrification and how do we not just hold each other accountable and have the difficult conversation with individuals, but I would submit, also have the conversation with institutions like MIT.

A lot of people were in the room, and they were talking about a framework to be able... A Black agenda, unapologetically Black, not people of color, but a framework that had smart measures that were specific measurable, attainable, and had time sensitive markers. A report card with the NAACP, and they talked about... And subsequent to that, they got everybody's emails and phone numbers, and we broke up into break out groups, and we've been having conversations and even Senator Wilkerson, who does the Wakanda, who was instrumental in getting Rachael Rollins elected, and tried to endorse Janie, they have subsequently, or I think on today, are going to veer that framework that they came up with, that they are endorsing Wu. So I thought that different pockets or silos are starting to come together with a framework that is supposed to be a metrics for the Black agenda, regardless of who's going to be the mayor, and to hold them accountable. And specific things like, we talked about more housing, but it was specific. Like 2,000 Black home ownership, within a timeframe.

We are living in a digital age now where we have access to YouTube and articles and all these other things. And so how much are we taking advantage of these critical information to help us to frame our understanding of what's happening in our communities? And so we are under 400 years of oppression where it's a constant catch up, and we haven't had an opportunity to once just usher into a space where we can finally be, but at the same time, in reverence and honor to our ancestors and folks that came before us, the tireless work that they've put out before us and becoming the first and dismantling here, mantling that, when do we take that back and prioritize it and put it at the very forefront? Because when desegregation occurred, it wasn't for us, it was to access our money. Because they knew that within a Black community, we are one of the biggest spenders. So what we had is never going to be equal because it wasn't with the intention of creating this for us to thrive and be, it was created just to give us a glimpse and make us feel we're a part when we're not. Our money is a part, our money is counted. But when it comes to proper education, and housing, and healthcare and everything else that other folks have lighter skin tones have an opportunity and access to, we are denied that.

So and then, growing up, I grew up with my son. And basically, I had to work two jobs, just to maintain, to make sure that he... I was a single mom, make sure he was able to go into programs and go to community centers and stuff like that. But I got to work in order for him to do that. You know what I mean? And the centers wasn't cheap. The program wasn't cheap. And me, because I couldn't afford education, [inaudible] had the money for it, my years and... So there's another question, education versus years and your position. If I got the experience, years of experience, but I don't have the education, when does that going to count again? Just because somebody was able to afford a education doesn't mean that they have knowledge and understanding or understand the population that they're dealing with. So I couldn't get those high paying jobs, because didn't had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean? So it goes all the way back to the affordable housing, I would be content, if I didn't have to raise my child and make sure he was equipped. If I didn't have to work two jobs, it's hard trying to juggle school work and your child, you know what I mean? So, I think we need to bring back affordable housing which is really affordable to middle class people, working people because when you are working, in my experience, you can't get certain benefits, you can't get TAFDC, you can't get food stamps, snap as you all call it benefits anymore, because you are overqualified. You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child.

So, don't look at my income and say that it's less than somebody else that has lower income. My needs is the same as that other person. So if my needs are not being met, right? How can I afford it? So their needs is not being met by this programming to help them meet those needs. But there's no programming for us middle class. So my question is, when are we going to have affordable housing?

For me watching, I'm going to cry, watching this guy who, he wanted to go to a party, but he couldn't get into the party because they were stints. And so it was really difficult for him. But I also watched even through the city of Boston, in Codman Square, people that were in wheelchairs and before they started looking at the ADA compliance sidewalks, it was difficult. They were looking for like her cuts to get onto the sidewalk. So I almost watched them get hit by cars because they're in the street trying to navigate getting around. And even to go to the playground to watch little kids and to see their hurdles, like trying to be a kid, get on some play structure. And it's just difficult without someone having to pick them up and all of it. My future, or what I would like to see happen is that accessibility is just without a question.

Firstly, I am a homeowner through one of Boston's programs that help to give affordable homeownership, but I believe like there are some loopholes that stifle our people. When you go through this process, it doesn't allow for advancement. What? It doesn't allow for advancement, they don't have any resources for the homeowners after the purchase, any guidance. And then, as Dorothy had said, they tend to... When you come up with an issue with the house and the quick build of that, money rules the factor of giving these contractors the job to do something, and then they use cheap materials and product. And I don't know if the inspection process part of it is skipped over just to get pushed along just to get the home sold. And then the City's not tentative to the homeowners when they get into a serious situation. And then the reason why you go through that is because of, like what Tarazer said, the pricing, the pay that you make. Half a million dollars for a property that's probably not equal to a half a million dollars' worth of property. And also to piggyback is: are they trying to do what they did in the '60s and move the colored people back onto the outskirts so it's comfortable for the upper class, so to speak, people to be able to access their jobs more easily and make things convenient? It's okay that we share, but be fair. So, don't just push us all out or whatever after we've built up the community and the livelihood of all the neighborhoods and brought that equity back, and now you slyly just push the minority population of the Dorchester Roxbury Mattapan communities out. And I hope that those fears don't come into the homeowners and they stay with their properties, because there's people that come out here like, ""We'll buy your house for X, Y, Z.""

So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system. And so that's something that since in Boston, I've been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there's a bank, somewhere, but I don't see that being implemented at all. And a big question for me is that we've been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn't been any discussions on personal. You're building these homes, you're building these spaces, we can't afford them because we can't get loans. So where's the disconnect? Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it's very predatory practices, it's just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that's one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we're having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks. And then the banks that are opened, there's no sense of community, you can't go in there, there's no one that really knows your name, no one's actually sitting there to try to figure out what they can screen you for, what products they have that would work for you. It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you're giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that's something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we're not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there? How can you usher us into a new space where we can walk into your space, and be able to say, ""I'd like a loan, please."" Actually, we don't even need to be able to ask for a loan, you should be coming to us because you go everywhere else, and you send fliers to X, Y and Z and you say, ""You're pre approved for this amount of money."" But how do we improve that line of communication and the ability for us to feel we can go to banks and be able to access the funds like we know a lot of other people can.",jamaica plain,"['community trends', 'institutions', 'housing', 'community life', 'education', 'economic opportunity', 'inequality']","['belonging', 'lack of action', 'expectations', 'homeownership', 'housing affordability', 'call to action', 'community relationships', 'community values', 'life skills', 'financial literacy', 'race-based', 'foreign-born']",202.19999999999982,404.39999999999964

And as a parent, when you talked about juggling work, school, and raising kids. That's something that not a lot of people that I know are... They don't have that knowledge of how to balance all of that together and also get a house. Usually, I mean, people in my generation, or at least or friends or my circle, they're just getting housing and trying to... If you scroll on Instagram, Facebook, it's like, ""Okay, who has the latest job? Who has the latest features or car?"" But our parents weren't worried about that, they were worried about is this the house I want? Is this is this rent good? I remember, my family was moving from... Obviously, when I was growing up, I didn't care where I lived, it was whatever it was good enough for me. But we moved from our apartment to a house. And that in and of itself, was the greatest thing for my family. It's now we have a house. And the idea of home ownership. I don't think people in the inner city understand that. You can literally, if you are a good parent, you can be looking at your children, and they won't see the suburbs or the rural areas and be like, ""I want that."" Though we see on TV, and understand that that's the life, but they won't look up to you and be like, ""We need to have a house."" But you are thinking, ""We need a house. This is what I want. I want to create generational wealth."" And that's something that I think people in my circle didn't grow up with that idea. It was just everything's here, we have an apartment, we have our household, we have education. But the idea of now getting affordable housing is something that is coming to the forefront of my mind. And how do you make sense of getting affordable housing? Where's the right place to do it? And thinking about not just getting a house but if you want to have a family, how do you now choose the right location for a school. How do you choose it, where you have good hospitals near you? And I think it's something that goes back to education, not just finances, though we need to understand how does housing happen? How do you make sure someone is held accountable if they're not hiring their friends to get this in the housing? How do you make sure everything connects and fits. And that's why I take it back to education, because if we're not just learning about 400 years of history, or the weather cyber, which is sometimes... It's important, but if we all are at the same understanding of what is going on our society, and I think you've talked about civic engagement. Voting, we don't talk about that in school at all. And it doesn't make any sense because there are so... You'll see signs of this mayor, this person for councilor, it's like, ""Who is this person?"" We're seeing these people every single day, but you don't understand your role. And I think it's also how to not only accountability for people who are in places in power, but how do we take accountability for ourselves, because we are citizens who have so much power. We have the power to vote, but not only that, we have the power to learn and make active change, to create community spaces, sit down and do it. But how do we understand our role?

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met. So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that's being funded by the taxpayers, that's being built by the city, and all these different things, and it's just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately. And in a space where there's a lot of just disorganization, and they're not being honest about things. And they're saying, ""Oh, this person's rejecting it, and not creating a full picture."" We're never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made. And no one goes back and says, ""Well, we know we want to be able to audit your paperwork, we want to be able to see what it is that you're doing. We want to have conversations with folks that you've had contact with to understand what customer service has been? What process has there been? Has it been transparent? What's happening? And so as we're working to build more spaces and build more housing for folks, I would really love to see this city or the next mayor really have a handle on what is actually happening. And I know that the mayor, she or he cannot do everything by themselves, but they also have to make sure that the folks that they're appointing around them has the capacity and the ability to really go forth and prioritize this.",jamaica plain,"['institutions', 'housing']","['expectations', 'accountability', 'processes', 'institutional resources', 'gentrification and displacement', 'housing affordability']",160.70000000000005,321.4000000000001

So it's clear, it's a unified conversation that needs to be had, probably everybody on this call, but they can speak for themselves, has been impacted by gentrification. I know that my grandfather, who came from Barbados, in the early 1900s, bought a house on [Stromard] Avenue, and was gentrified out, in the 1980s. After having a house, well, it was his daughter, my mother, who actually received the house after he passed away, but she was gentrified out because it became unaffordable for her to live there, because of taxes. Now it's a multimillion dollar home, on the corner of Stromard and Massachusetts Avenue. As I said, five generations of Rocks have lived over and impacted in that house, and unfortunately, it's gone now. That's the, I think, the collective experience of Black folks in Boston, being pushed out from one neighborhood to another. The impact is great, it's an emotional strain. In many ways, I'm not sure about this whole issue about a conversation. I think it's overstated, about conversations. Because we've been having conversations for years, about gentrification. In fact, Collins and Kevin White and others, already had a master plan for Boston, and that has been in the making for, now, close to 100 years. So when people say, ""Let's have a conversation,"" have a conversation with who? There was a group back... And I know all of you all can relate to this, is that there was a group back in the day, called The Vault, and The Vault made the decisions, regarding what happened; politically, economically, socially, morally, and everything else, in the City of Boston.

How are you going to treat our neighborhood if I decide to let you in to my network of people to talk to them to figure out what they want? What is the end result? How are you going to represent us statistically? How are you going to talk about us in a way that highlights and celebrates all of our diversity?"" Which you were talking about Somala, which is something that I always talk about. And then, the other thing that we, well, I always think about is that the leadership comes in different forms and this is something that Jasmine said, and why is it that people are always looking for leadership to look a certain way? Leadership looks so different with so many different people in our neighborhoods. I often wonder about the youth in our neighborhood, everybody's looking for the shiny, bright youth in our neighborhood. What about the youth that are struggling? They could be shiny and bright too. Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I'm sorry my memory's a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they've chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she's at school, ""Everybody I'm just going into the Military."" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don't see too many Latinas in the field that she's in. She's in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways. So I'm just all over the place because I agree with everything everybody said. And I have an accent but you only hear it when I'm angry and you only hear the southern part.

When I say that, there is nothing in Boston, like it was before. For our children, there're no centers, there're no activities. There's nothing to make them feel like they belong to the city of Boston. We have to fight so how for them. My experience in my life goes back to my three sons. I was a single mother and I was raising three sons, and all I heard all through their lives was statistics, crime. You know they're not going to be this, they are not going to be that. You know people were putting them down, their peer people were putting them down as a young African American child. Schools, Community Centers. Just people that they looked up too. So, that led me to fight for them. To travel with them. To make sure that they're okay. To make sure that they earn and get what they need to get out of Boston as I did for a child that my mother gave me. I wanted them to believe in their selves that they can accomplish anything in life. They could do anything they want in life. Nothing, no word, no action could take place in theirs lives that would stop them. That just made me get more into their education. It made me follow through their education, until I made sure that they were okay to able to stand up and finish the rest of their lives as men. To not be statistics, not go to jail, not do this, not do that. The city of Boston has to understand that it is all about our children. We have lived our lives, we have done everything in our lives, and we have a lot of children here that are suffering and can not get the quality lives that we already had, and it's not fair to them. So, my mission is to fight for our children. My place in Boston in the future, I want to have the biggest organization for the children because they have so much talent, and so much to offer, and I want to be a voice for them. I want to carry their voices on my back, and once we get where we are going I want to take them off my back and put them in front of me and make sure that they are able to talk as loud as they can and accomplish everything they can.

These are human beings and they do have problems that we all have. Some of us can come up out of it, and some of us can not. They are homeless, but they are allowing them to live in the street, and not giving them the stuff that they need in order to get well. I work in that area, and I see the tents, I walk by the tents. I feed the hungry at my job. The hungry, I mean I feed families at my job where I'm at. Every morning when I go there at 6:30. In the park, all I see is a lot of tents. They are beautiful people. I talk to them, and when you look at them and you hear their story. As small as a mustard seed of what happened to them, and all they are asking for is help. Basically the city should be ashamed of themselves in that we have a big population of the homeless that's in Boston. Now, back in the day, I had a sister that was out there too. It was a long time ago, and a sister is someone that you really love and you really want to do what you can, but you can never understand her situation. So I feel really bad for them, because they do have families like my sister did. But that is what she chose to do. Just like the both of you said, we need to help. That should be number one of every ones list, to try to get help for these young men and young women. That's part of homelessness, and Boston has never been like that before. It's okay. One quick thing, I think that... I think that, we are all on here today, they need people like us to help absolve this homeless problem. We could be homeless in a minute, just like Mrs. Webb said. We can, but we have the tools to help these people. We are sitting in our homes, we are looking at the news and we are trying to understand what's going on, and we got the answer here, but we can't voice our opinions.

So, in a little bit of detail from me more in an example to elaborate is, I was appointed by the mayor to serve on the search committee for the superintendent of Boston Public Schools. That was something that a lot of people within our governmental stand were not proud of. They didn't want to talk and they didn't want to see it happen.

And the credit score and everything was changing where I did have a decent credit score, but everything was changing. There was a lull for like two or three years where it didn't seem like anyone could buy anything. You know what I'm saying? With the whole watching ... Like I said, with watching housing change where there were housing being sold, three family homes, like I live in Dorchester. For instance, living here in Dorchester versus someone who may live in Roxbury where they started talking about the word regentrification. To be on this side of how everyone had to highlight on Roxbury, I'm one of the people who living here in this community would say that Dorchester is being regentrified, and no one was paying attention to that because like I said the three family homes were being sold, but they're being sold and they're being turned into condos, and how do you turn a three family home and all of a sudden start saying that these are condo floors, and each floor now costs $360,000 versus a home, that whole home would run you $500,000. You know what I'm saying? I personally witnessed that. That's where my question comes from with the formula in pricing based of ... Where I think the housing crash happened, it took away, I think, the American dream of a hard working person owning a home and being able to own a home and say possibly use one of their floors to be their small business or like I said a second income. That's what I've seen with the what happened to housing since 2008, and the way that is continuing. That's a part of the whole plan of where she says the whole plan of before was what was Boston going to look like in 2020, and now the whole vision is 2030, and just that part like where is rent going to go from here if an average three bedroom apartment if you can get it to say apartment and not condo is running like $2,200, $2,300 and more. There's something a lot of people who have decent jobs that work for the T, that work for the police, I work for the city, one of the city department divisions, and that's astronomical to be asking somebody to spend $2,000 a month.

Where is that discussion at because that's really important for people that live in the community that don't know? I know there were some evacuation signs, but I was told there really wasn't ... And the other thing is the tyranny that goes along with we voted for cannabis and consumption, and the stigmatization that went along with people who did smoke cannabis. And then you have these judges that lock up a lot of cannabis users. And now some of these judges, I wouldn't say all of them, but I wouldn't be surprised if they're not in the cannabis industry. Those judges that sent these young, and I say black and brown and Latino people to jail including my loved one. My family was incarcerated because they were an addict and they used drugs to provide for their addiction. What about crime? But they still did jail time unlike the addicts of today that they want to find them injection centers. They're not injection centers but there are places where they can go and indulge in the activity of their choice. They want to provide shelters for these addicts of today. They want to put them on Front Street in the prime areas where there's business owners. There's a black hotel down there. We won't even know that it's a black hotel. When it was open, we did very much go over there and have a great time, but now with the drug addiction people that are surrounding those areas who's helping those business owners to get back to the level where they deserve to get the revenue that they deserve. But because of the eyesore like where's that conversation at. And the consumerism, we can go into the cigar bars and you can go into the bars and you can do hookah, and you can do cigars. You can't do cannabis, but we voted for that, like you owe us that. There's tyranny there. And who's talking about that? It's not okay. It's just not okay.

And the last thing is Nathaniel Holland Fenway Park. Those parks are for the people, but the people can't use them. In other words, there was just a write-up in the Globe that Fenway had never had lined the Urban Act in the whole history of the Fenway Park. I have never, ever wanted to say, ""Hey son, let's go to Fenway Park for an hour."" Never, and I take my kids on a lot of outings. And the other thing is the youth center, when I played football and one of the things I always was very happy about in all the years that I played with my children is when we go to those games the people who support them always had a banner, so we knew who the business owners that support our children.

Seeing the way that the city highlights gentrification as a positive thing, has been something that's been on my mind, just because seeing the brochures for these newer housing complexes and stuff and it's just like, ""It's like newly gentrified neighborhood"", you know what I mean? So now I'm like, [inaudible]. But you know what I mean? Yeah, connotation and context is super important, like as far as the communities go. But I definitely resonate with the stories that you both shared. Obviously, as someone who lived in Roxbury and Grove Hall, my entire life and now I'm living in the North End, because it's more affordable than where I used to live, is like that's a direct result of the ways that my community is currently and has been gentrified. I think that it's important also to recognize that for many different people, their circumstances are different. You know what I mean? We have different lived experiences and different like economic, we have different I guess ideas of economic stability and lived experiences with that, as well.

It's like, kind of the idea of community that I share, or that I have and that I hold dear, is like very different than a lot of other people. I definitely think that seeing the gentrification that's taking place right now, it's very reminiscent of how the community kind of felt very disparate when I was younger, do you know what I mean? Because, you have people that you're close to, you have your kind of blood relatives and your blood family members and stuff like that.

It's more so around the foundations that are being laid by the city to be able to have those people move in. You know what I mean? I think that divide is something that happens a lot. I saw that happen like my own household, just like with adopted siblings and myself. You know what I mean, with my birth mom and sister, it's just like, it's easy for us to fight each other and kind of not like each other, because it's like, ""Oh you're this and this and you know whatever."" But it's not really conducive to an environment that we can all grow and thrive in. You feel me? Like there can be like space for people to be able to live in affordable housing and I mean there can be [inaudible] folks who are, you know what I mean? Like whether they're a part of the artist community or they're a part of the business community, whatever, to be able to find space. Because there shouldn't be that, like one group of people shouldn't be pushed out for another group of people to be able to thrive. You feel me? I feel like until the city has that in mind, so that concept gets through their skulls, we're not going to be able to have a clear understanding of who, of what community actually feels like.

I'm an advocate for education and it's a huge disappointment to come to Boston, which I feel is the city of education and across the river is Harvard and MIT and like a two or three stops on a train, you're in Boston and I'm hearing about children in schools that are crumbling are afraid to go to the restroom and then forget about the pandemic. So I don't want to go on about it because it just gets me so angry. But I am all about education and I'm really happy that this program is happening because we really need to listen and find the people that are afraid to speak because I believe those are the people that, maybe they're fearful, but I believe those are the people that have the answers and maybe they're not courageous or they're afraid to step forward, but I believe with programs like this, it might give them an opportunity to speak. And if any of these mayors or government officials are smart, they should start listening. From the middle school child up into the seniors that are also being ignored. So, that's my two cents. So I really hope Boston changes. Between the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, these are big wake-up calls and from this point forward there's no excuse for us to make, not only Boston, but the rest of the United States, just a better place and set an example globally.",mattapan,"['institutions', 'public health', 'education', 'inequality']","['expectations', 'covid-19', 'quality of education', 'race-based']",134.0,268.0

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color. So my question would be, why is this still happening in 2021? Racism is not something that has vanished, so I know why it's happening but also like why is it happening? But it's just I guess like a rhetorical question, like why is it happening and why aren't we fixing it as a city, as a community, to make sure that students in places that are far out Massachusetts are getting the same instructions, the same love, and the same attention, the same push in Boston that they're doing in Massachusetts? I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",mattapan,"['education', 'inequality']","['quality of education', 'race-based', 'class-based']",157.79999999999973,315.59999999999945

So I can see firsthand of how home culture can get confused with school culture and the school culture is totally different and teachers are doing the best that they can, but there will never be a connection without that home culture. So that's where they misunderstand and misinterpret our children's signs. Somebody might see my son as aggressive, but it's probably passionate or a cry for, ""I don't understand.""

And one of the things about it was that a lot of the young people that went, they went because they were either kicked out or had difficulty either learn differently or whatever in the traditional school system. And so as an experiment, I thought that this is a skewed experiment because what you're doing is that you're loading the experimental school. If you're really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn't take them out and put them in an experiment. So we was filled with kids who had behavioral issues, or had some difficulty in a lot of ways in dealing with the typical system.

Because I don't live in public housing.

It was because of the workers that worked at the hospital. After the doctor does the procedure you go to the- The nurse in the recovery room. Yeah, like the staff. And those people there are people who they might want to be a nurse, didn't make the nurse or whatever. One of the guys happened to use drugs, and I accused him of taking my drugs. But the long story is after I got out of that hospital, which was a nightmare, and I had to fight literally and tell them, ""Do not send any residents in my room anymore. Only send medical doctors. And do not come in here and tell me what you're going to do for me,"" because they were going to send me home with an oxygen tank. They was about to run it up. Because I was advocating for myself I knew that I had to get off the drugs and I had to see the medical doctor and not their little resident. But I didn't complain after I was discharged. I should've called the chaplain. I should've put in a written complaint so that nobody had to endure what I endured. And that's the thing that I was saying because the preventive is good, but then when we go through these experiments and these excruciating changes due to the doctor may be having an overload or just not educated, whatever it is, but then we don't write it down and complain so they can't fix the problem. So it's kind of like a two-fold. When we go through these things it's so important to go back and write that complaint because they have people on staff that only do that, and they want that information from us.

I know that they're lots bad reasons, but I grew up in a college town in Vermont and so I had an excellent education. And I came to Boston and I was committed to having my three sons go through the Boston Public School system, which they did. They graduated. They went all the way. But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp. And so she was really tough on them and the parents all complained the kids are getting ulcers, they are having nightmares and everything. Like it was really hard for the kids and because of that, one of my sons went to this school, one of my sons went to that school. I imagine their capabilities are comparable but I can see how it happens that because of a small difference, one goes this way and one goes that way. And certainly when there are much bigger differences, including the color of your skin and the way you speak and how much your parents were able to invest in your education, I mean, reading you stories when you were an infant or even in the womb or whatever.

If we don't get something in gear... We don't have buildings that are adequate. They don't even have air conditioning. You've got mice in the stairwell. Kids are getting moldy lunches. And yet and still, you tell me there's a budget for school lunch, but then you're serving the kids salami. What are you doing with the money realistically? Because I know all of the money that's in budget is not being dwarfed by a sandwich of cold salami. Someone really needs to think about why everybody's pushing their kids to charter school, because no one wants their kid in a Boston public education, because it's not there. So that's key, because you can't have the next level working force of these educated kids, if they're not educated. And then you wonder why they're hanging on the corners, because a lot of times the parents get discouraged. They can't keep track of the kids. The kids feel burdened, because they see their moms struggling. And then they go and resort to things, so that they can try and help. And then they end up being profiled, and then they end up being in a system. And then you end up with all the things that are happening every day on the news. And then they look at us like we're savages, and we don't know what we're doing. But a lot of times you have kids raising kids. If you've got young kids, and then they don't have that matriarch to give them the education, to give them the knowledge that they need and the support and structure. So if the services were there, if the housing was out of the way, and they weren't worried about the landlord kicking them out or raising their rent or whatever the case, or family members having to stay with them, because they've been kicked out, we'd have less struggle there. And therefore, they could concentrate on other things and give the kids the attention, be at the parent teacher meetings, like they should be, and be involved, and be a voice in the community like they should. So if we had had a seat at the table, if we were offered more of these seats on these boards, where the decisions were being made...

I know that there's some small group that like to be outside because it's hard to be in a shelter, but I don't feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don't mean just treatment, but having things like there's something called the housing first model where you don't put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, ""You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we'll fill out your verification of homelessness form."" All these things that just make it that much harder. It's harder to be sober when you're out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can't have all the solutions, it's complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I'd like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who've lived here for decades and have been here, I don't like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states. So we should have housing for medium income levels too and low income and the elderly and disabled and all of that.",mission hill,"['institutions', 'public health', 'housing']","['lack of action', 'processes', 'institutional resources', 'drugs and drug use disorder', 'gentrification and displacement', 'housing instability']",143.20000000000005,286.4000000000001

So I said, let me walk to this friend's house because usually they are at home, maybe I can use their phone and get a ride back to my house or whatever I got to do. So I was on my way to the friend's house and I saw the friend in that area. So I didn't even make it to their house. And I was asking them, ""Oh hey, my phone got wet in the rain. I don't have a bus pass. I need to call a ride. Can I use your phone?"" And they was like, ""Oh, my phone's off. I'm going to go pay my bill now."" So I was going to go with them to pay their bill. So I asked, ""Can I just walk with you or whatever?"" And they act like they didn't know me. So that led me to go to wait for them at their house. They said, I could wait for them at their house because they didn't know how long it was going to take. So I got a little antsy. So I knocked on a neighbor's door and they opened the door and I asked them, I said, ""Hey, I need some help. I just need to use a phone. I'm a friend of your neighbors."" And I've seen them before and they've seen me before and they just started attacking. So you can imagine how strange that was. It was a very serious altercation. It was more than one person attacking me. Someone called the ambulance because I was obviously beaten up and I had to go to Boston Medical and mind you, I still had no phone. And my family started worrying about me. They had to put a missing persons report because remember I had no phone, I wasn't home. And I was never able to use someone else's phone. And it bothered me that when somebody could be needing help or something and they knock on your door and the first thing you do is attack them, you don't try to give, you know what I mean, help them out and see if there's anything, if they need to use a phone or if you could show them where the ... just help out instead of ... like, the first instinct was for these people to attack me.

And I could pull from my history something applicable. So I think I might honor all three and say a little bit about all. In terms of Cindy's experience with racism, growing up, I remember walking home from Boston Bowl and this is on the east side of Washington. And it was four of us. We were all Black from the west side of Washington and the only way to get to Boston Bowl was walk. And we got jumped on our way coming back from bowling and car of young white men, young white boys jumped out and started to swing at us with golf clubs. I remember getting hit at my chest and the club breaking off. And ironically, how we got out of that, a vehicle stopped with an interracial couple. And then the neighbors who saw who were all white, came down to help us because they didn't feel what was happening was right which is true. And so that really tainted my view on some of the race issues, because at around the same time we were being bused as well, from Dorchester to, I was bused from Dorchester to West Roxbury- the Joyce Kilmer. So that touched my life. And then something else that really resonated with me too that's worthy of calling out is the issues that this country, the world is facing with climate change. And it's a real thing. And Boston, like this storm coming the T-stop in the South Bay has to be four to five, so that the station wouldn't get a flood with the anticipated storm coming. So it is real. There'll be more storms like this. And I'm working to get the word around about climate change. And then the third aspect is the mental health issues and challenges that we as a community face. They really overlap with a lot of the different things that we are concerned about at this table right now. And if we can see the connection, you can see how important it is to act today. With mental health, we don't really see it as a job issue, but it really is because when lives are stable and incomes are comparable to the national average, lives are better and the stress is less and you don't look for self-medication and you treat your kids better. So the quality of life all the way around where all of these things seem seemingly not connected are very interwoven like a sweater. So we have to really take a mindset of all the challenges that we have.",mission hill,"['community trends', 'public health', 'safety', 'infrastructure', 'economic opportunity']","['unjust', 'disempowered', 'mental health', 'racialized violence', 'climate impacts', 'transportation', 'income']",237.19999999999982,474.39999999999964

I moved here after living in Grove Hall and I came to shell shock because over there I had Black neighbors like myself and then I came here and it was primarily white. My first experience was going up to the playground in Mission Hill and having a white kid punched me in the face, no reason at all. And then our first encounter was my sister having to beat him up. And then in the fall, turns out that he's in my class. And so this is the beginning of my life as a middle schooler, listening to the stories of the high school and them having race wars and us fighting with our friends who were friends in school but as soon as we crossed the street from the Catholic middle school that we went to, then it was all hell that broke out. And so I became an activist when I was 14, very young. And probably at that time subconsciously leading to my adult life as an activist, I never did anything in Mission Hill. I never wanted to have anything to do with this area, but sleeping. And so I think that probably about three or four years ago, I joined the board of our neighborhood bus but before that, I still had a lot of that animosity. So the systemic racism that exists now as the community and cultural engagement manager at Mass General hospital, I'm doing my best to break down a lot of those walls and having to fight with white people to get them to see why this is not a handout or a hand up, but it's just telling them that they as a system need to give back to a community that they've turned their back on for so many years.",mission hill,"['community trends', 'safety', 'community life', 'education', 'inequality']","['unjust', 'betrayed', 'disempowered', 'empowered', 'racialized violence', 'resident actions', 'community values', 'youth spaces', 'race-based']",138.10000000000036,276.2000000000007
79,1412,2021-08-21,5244662,1839.7,1995.0,"The reason I ask that is because my journey into racial justice organizing started when I was a teenager in the Boston public schools, and I was from Weymouth, but I was part of a regional group. And 19 of the 30 kids were from Boston public high schools. And it was in 1975, 76, 77. So it was right after school desegregation and the city was going coocoo. And I did not understand why everybody was so mad that people that look like all of you on the call wanted what I already had when we all pay taxes and public education is supposed to be free for everybody? So anyway, I spent the next 15 years trying to understand that and study it. And I have come to understand that most people who are leaders in our nation don't know the history of structural racism. So my question is probably, what are you going to understand the history of structural racism and how it impacts us today and what you're going to do about it? Drop the mic. So now I'm going to read to you what we were supposed to do the last time, because this is only my first time doing the conversation. The resonance is supposed to be with an individual. What I want you to do next is think back to each of the questions. We did two, so it could be either one and their experiences that were just shared in the group. And then find someone whose question or experiences resonates with your own life. Then I want you to speak to that person and tell them why their question or experience resonated with you and share a story from your life that connects with their experience. So I'm going to give everybody a minute to do that. And actually the last conversation we had so much in common that we didn't say specifically. So this is an upgrade, especially for those who will be doing conversations because we're assuming there'll be people that have different questions and come from different walks of life. And we really want the opportunity for people in these conversations to share directly with somebody else and make that personal connection. So who would like to go first?

And I know that housing as an issue began somewhere in the 70s, with veterans returning and two things, war is hell. So many veterans come return home, male and female, with a lot of issues that there should be institutions there to help people resolve their issues of what's now known as PTSD. That wasn't even a channel to turn to, if you will. Over all of our wars as this country, there been no notifications and the name has changed to protect the innocent. But at same time, you did not see the numbers of homelessness that you do now. And again, it's started in a very different time. You also had a situation under I believe, maybe Ronald Reagan, if any youngins can remember that, where the deinstitutionalization of folks who had issues not necessarily war related, but had mental health issues, spiritual issues that were in an essence turned out into the streets. Because the theme at the time is, well, we can find a place for them to come and get their medication. And they can self medicate, and blah, blah, blah, which was absolute down to Coca Cola. Now you move to a time now, where the bottom is beginning to become thicker, because of our social economic situation, Nancy spoke to and please don't misunderstand. But her position as a white person in Boston, even with that, there were prevailing kinds of situations economically, socially, that have now thickened again, the bottom of people who otherwise would not have the same worries or concerns. And how do we take that super huge problem and crystallize it and stop the life out of it, if you will, to bring it to the larger body because the body of people who are falling under that social economic state is growing. And it's including everybody, people who maybe once thought that they were safe. When you think about homelessness and you think about people in this town, in this city, who are second generation homeless. I'm not talking about just falling off to a corner somewhere.

I'm 23 years old, but I lived in the city for so long and I've also been born and raised here within and New York. So I was raised here and I was also raised in the Bronx, but one thing I've understood is, not all minorities are accepted in every neighborhood. We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I'm a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there's many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn't a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it's two cities in one. So it's very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I'm from Boston, I'm from the bean, I'm a Red Sox fan. I'm the official patriarch. There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions. So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city? Because we're the ones who make Boston real. We're the ones who make it, the way it is, the persona of being a Bostonian, is not these out of state people. That's my difficulty of understanding.

That that's all well and good, but this is a city, and I would say as people living in the city, you have to be cautious. There are some people in the city that are not well. There are some people that involve themselves in things, and it takes awhile. Sometimes suddenly you're listening to the opinions and the ideas of other people, and they're just not... you just, just work on yourself. Go inward, work on yourself, work on your intuition. And if your gut, always go with your gut, if your gut tells you, ""Wait a minute, that didn't sound right. That person didn't sound like they were really supportive of my ideas."" And what I found is, any idea you have that comes from within you, any goal that you set as something that you want to do, you don't let anybody else interfere with that. When people come home, have opinions and want to interfere, you sometimes have to cast that aside, because everyone's different. And we all have an innate ability to preserve ourselves and to reach our goals, especially if those goals are toward the betterment of humanity and the betterment of ourselves, and the betterment of pretty much the universe.

When I came to this country, not from another state, but from another country, you feel alone. There are not many people like you from your country who speak your language. But if you start in the city where you live, there are social centers, for example, community centers, the school where your kids go, they have potlucks, they have open houses. So you start going to this event and you make friends with the parents and you start going to all the events at the schools, especially if you are... you like to be involved in your kid's school, you go to the event, you talk to the teachers and then little by little, you see that people are not really different.

I'm currently in a community service club here at Northeastern, and one of the things that we did was a culture walk. So we were able to walk around all the different communities and neighborhoods that surround Northeastern, like Roxbury and Dorchester. And we went through all different communities of Boston that I've personally not been to before. And something that was kind of eye opening to me was that I didn't, since I've never been to them before, I didn't really know that they were there. And it was kind of like a very reflective experience because I was wondering why I haven't been to those communities before and why this club that I was participating in thought we would benefit from these walks. And I realized that it is so important to familiarize yourself with the communities that surround you. Especially since the Northeastern campus is kind of, it can be kind of isolating if you don't walk beyond the borders of it, it can feel like its own little isolated place where everything is all students, and all... this one type of community and culture and academic rigor. But you walk just like 10 minutes outside of the campus lines and there's a whole different community and culture at play. So that was something that was very eye-opening to me. And I think that's why I came to that question, because even though I did engage in those neighborhood and community walks, I still want to learn more about it. And I still want to be confident in my familiarity with those communities. And I want to be able to hopefully one day see myself as a part of that community too.

I heard people say, ""Well, Sarah, don't tell them this because they'll go back and say Sarah told me to do this."" So, [inaudible]. But that's my opinion.

You're not allowed to take the computers apart, work with it, experiment. They only let you do a certain level of configuration, but that's it. When you go out into the real world, it's a lot different. It's a lot, lot different. You won't understand Excel. Okay, I've got two certificates from Excel at a really good IT school, and in Excel, they got us to do a couple of links to a couple of pages, do a couple of formulas, and that was about it, where you can go in and enter the information in this page, and the information will appear in the next page. You might type a form in MS Word, and then embed the information from Excel to that Word form, and that was it. I mean, it looked great. It was fantastic to learn it. But when I got into the work environment and I got handed a Excel document, it's a good thing I was strong with Excel, because that Excel document had about 500 different lines that I had to go through looking to do that entry and the make sure that there was no mistakes in the other part of the balance sheet, another page on the Excel. And if it did, I had to find where the mistake was. That was a big difference. In the community college, it was just two links to two pages, but in the real world, it was a huge [crosstalk]. Okay. Okay. So, like that, the same way it is with IT. You look at a few computers, but the computers are... You cannot put them together or take them apart completely. They stare. You do a couple of things, and voila. You know, you're not... Yeah. Okay. So, you have... Okay. All right. So, I get it.

I kind of had a suspicion, but I found out, literally like two days ago, that I had an IEP growing up. I grew up working lower middle-class, so I went to the poor school in my town, in New Hampshire. Even though it was under resource, relative in that community, I still could get access to a speech pathologist. I still got access to certain supports. So when I moved to Boston, that's when I was mentioned when I went and worked at the Burke High School, it was just wild to see how under... There were really wonderful students and really committed teachers, but no relative resources. There was like four staff members that were socio emotionally supported, and they only got that because they were a turn around school. So they get money to be in turn around, to avoid going into receivership, but once they get out of turn around, they lose the extra funding. The students that were coming to school and trying to learn every day... One of the students I was working with, I found out at the very end. Like, I worked for all year and he struggled all year, coming into school, and at the end of the year, I was chatting with him. I called his family and did other things like that, and he told me. ""Mr., to be honest, I've been homeless almost the entire time."" And I'm like, ""Jesus."" That would have totally changed my approach, and I don't think a lot of the people at the school actually knew. I think they would have tried, but there was just... I think it was not a lack of will or care for these students, cause teachers and staff were amazing, it was they were students who had... Because it was a mostly Black and Brown school, so many intersecting issues that the students face, and there was just no capacity to do it. So I think that just really struck me, just thinking about myself. Like even in my town, I had challenges relative to that, but I was like, ""My life would have been so different,"" and to what folks are saying, it's material. This has material impact on people's lives. If I didn't have access to that support, I have no idea where I would be, so I think that just makes that level of building, not just education, but also ensuring that we're expanding what education means, beyond what we currently think it is. Including those soft skills, including the socio emotional skills, including... Find better words for me. Cultural incompetent, which I don't like that word. But the idea of valuing and other cultures, and recognizing that if you're working with someone, you need to value their background, so you can actually work with them in a way that's relevant to them. And I agree, that's very, very lacking. And to the same degree, a lot of students in that school and other, where I also worked at, Hyde Square Task Force in Jamaica Plain, a lot of those students, even though it's in Jamaica Plain, a lot of their families are being forced out into Brockton, or into other places, or being displaced. So it's very clear who the city, the power structures, and the White supremacist power structures in the city, are favoring, and who they think should live here. And I think that's something that's got to change, cause even if... Gentrification is not viable. If they destroy those elements of Boston's culture, the city's not going to work. We have a lot of empty luxury condos, let me tell you that. They're building up my neighborhood, all over the place, and I'm like, ""I know who you're building to live there, but no one... "" It's just bonkers to me, to be destroying what actually has kept Boston. Like what has made it a place that people can actually live and want to go to. Cause a lot of people say it's not very friendly and that it's very professional and too fast. I'm like, ""There's a reason for that.

But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp.

My mom grew up in the Mission District in San Francisco, which is heavily Latin X, heavily Mexican, and bit by bit, the places that we used to go for things, certain foods, my favorite burrito place, my favorite spot for different desserts and things like, that's gone. It literally just disappears, and so [inaudible]... That's just one example, in San Francisco. I would say the same thing about Somerville. I lived, for some time, outside of Union Square.

Different kinds of flavor, and you could walk into these spaces and get that kind of flavor, that kind of culture, that kind of... All those things that come along with food. And you could walk in there... I've actually recently visited, and it's not the same. It's not that kind of thing that it used to be, when I lived out there for 12 years. And I'm starting to see that in Boston as well. I'm starting to see, I think, on a negative front, a lot of places getting pushed out farther and farther. You're starting to see places go into Malden and Quincy, and that's cool. I'm glad that places are still existing, but those places, some of them used to be in Boston. On the more positive front, I'm also starting to see some new spaces coming up, like 50 Kitchen, in Dorchester, that's a pretty awesome spot. There's a couple real cool spots out in... I mentioned Somerville, but I know my friend Elliot has a restaurant called Tanam, that's out near Bow Street Market, so there's these little gems that I'm starting to see, but not as fast as these other places are going away.

My house burned, and they kicked me son out of school three times. I had to get an education attorney, and I had to, because as long as we stayed homeless, he had stay-put rights, so I stayed homeless. In my car and families' houses, and the whole nine.

If you're really trying to understand what could be a more advantageous school system or whatever, and you put it with folks who, in a lot of way anybody whose kid was doing well in the traditional system wouldn't take them out and put them in an experiment.

So my question now is, what do they fall back on? It's difficult to get into some of the limited programs and if you don't get into those then what? But let's say you make it through the high school, okay, but if you're not in the Ivy League's and you don't get into those competitive school, then what? It just seems like there's always another roadblock and it seems to be affecting certain population and maybe less impacting others. So that's a concern that I see growing as we progress.

But one of the things that I noticed is that... Well, I'll tell you why I ask that question. I believe that we need to have things that are passed down. We need some generational wealth. We need to be secure. And what we get we need to be able to keep it. We need to have something that can't be taken away from us. Like, if we get housing and we buy these houses in the community, I'm concerned about somebody coming in and offering somebody three or four times what their house is worth so that they can blockbust the community. And pretty much like Priscilla was saying with gentrification, when they want it they just come back and take it. We need some protection against that. And, the equality part of that is that it needs to be in the communities of color. Like I said, I live in what's called the West End. It's right next to North End with the Italians. Their equity is passed down through their families, their generations. They keep theirs. So, I worked at Unity Bank back in the day in the 70s and I watched money flowing through Boston. And we had opportunities then for equity. It's about education. We're not educating our young people to say, okay, we don't need those Jordan sneakers, we don't need this that and the other, we need stuff that we're going to be able to pass down to generations. We're going to leave a legacy. So, that's with my issue. That's my experience that has led me to this. I'd watched people just lose everything, and get pushed out. That's my experience.

I think about this Boston that so many people admire, you watch the news and you see all the college students moving in to Boston, all over to go to school and you heat the parent on the news, talking about helping their child move in to go to school from Boston, because Boston has the best fist. We're leading in education, we have the best colleges and universities. Even Boston, Boston was promoted on Grey's Anatomy. The medical institutions down here was promoted on shows and other shows, but was promoted on stuff like Grey's Anatomy, Boston. And it's amazing, the view that people who live outside of the city has versus the view folks have that live within Boston. And just like I said, some folks are trying to get out of Boston. And I think that we need to be okay with that. I grew up in the city. I came to this country when I was seven years old, but I grew up in Boston, didn't know anything else, but Boston. And I would not buy a home in Boston. I just wouldn't. I am tired of the city. I'm tired of the violence in the city. I'm just tired. And there's a lot of collective trauma in the city of Boston that needs healing, collectively. Boston is traumatic. So there's benefits, but there's a lot of traumas in our community and a lot of trauma in Boston. There's just healing that needs to happen. I said it to somebody the other day when they try to entertain this conversation even about politics and the outcome of the mayoral race. I just feel like we're so confused. We're so divisive. The same people that yell unity are the same ones that are throwing out. Instead of being divisive, the same people that say we need to work together are the same people that are marginalizing other people and it's frustrating. I think there's definitely a balance, that you have to walk in optimism. Understanding you're going to be pessimistic, but just having a balance and not allow it to overtake you mentally, physically, emotionally, I just refuse.

What are those other communities doing that's keeping it out of their communities? There's no gun manufacturers in Roxbury. There's no poppy fields in Roxbury, Dorchester.

I know that they're lots bad reasons, but I grew up in a college town in Vermont and so I had an excellent education. And I came to Boston and I was committed to having my three sons go through the Boston Public School system, which they did. They graduated. They went all the way. But of course, they were smart white boys, and they were tracked well, so they probably got the best of the resources, but I know that. So I had an older son and then twin sons. The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp. And so she was really tough on them and the parents all complained the kids are getting ulcers, they are having nightmares and everything. Like it was really hard for the kids and because of that, one of my sons went to this school, one of my sons went to that school. I imagine their capabilities are comparable but I can see how it happens that because of a small difference, one goes this way and one goes that way. And certainly when there are much bigger differences, including the color of your skin and the way you speak and how much your parents were able to invest in your education, I mean, reading you stories when you were an infant or even in the womb or whatever.

And I was born and grew up in the heart of the civil rights era. So I definitely have my own view and my own interpretation of things that I see and things that happen around me. And the one thing that my father was constantly working to drill and instill in us is to know and to understand who's at the table. And he was one of those people that, if there wasn't a table, he'd build one. And you don't leave people out. The best way to have a community conversation is to have everyone from the community. Those close by, even those folk who are far away, you include them in the conversation. And I look at where we are now on my street, on Brinsley street. We used to know everybody on our street. We used to know all of our neighbors. So when you talk about the kids having things to do and places to go, that wasn't so much an issue because all of our households had a hand in making that happen for kids. I can truthfully say to you now that I can't really walk out my front door and call anyone by name. My neighbor to my left has a lot of kids. And her kids call me neighbor, because I'll do stuff for them, I'll buy ice cream or treats or whatever, hand it to them. But they see me and they go, ""Hi neighbor."" That's our life now. It used to be that we knew them, they knew us. We knew about each other. We knew how to help each other. It was more than just a casual wave to someone, ""Hey, how you're doing?"" So, that's missing. So now I think that in our community conversations... I think much like this call, it needs to be intergenerational. It's got to have Gail on the call, and I should be on the call and Marilyn should be there. We need Shamika and David to be there, to bring that perspective that oftentimes is beyond us because we are not thinking along that vein anymore. So we need to be cognizant of who's at the table, and then we need to make a concerted effort to make certain that if we're not there, we get them there. And if we need to, we need to build another table that's big enough to accommodate everybody so that we can all be a part of the conversation.",roslindale,"['institutions', 'community life']","['processes', 'community resources', 'call to action', 'community relationships', 'community values']",215.29999999999973,430.59999999999945

I've been working in one regard, the other with young people for the last 10 years and just doing life with them, spending time with them, mentoring, hanging out, just seeing this consistent theme of young people, especially brown and black young people, not feeling like they have anywhere to go when stuff is going wrong around them. And when they're facing a trial or something, or trauma or whatever it may be. So many times it's either they turn to their peers or they're keeping it in, or unfortunately, turn into other things to try and fill that void. And so I spent a lot of time working with young people in the context of the church. And so, a lot of it is spiritual-based, but as I grew older, I just really felt this need of, ""We can do more for these young people, than have them for two hours at a church service on a Friday night."" And so for me, it was just very looking for, ""How do I find a holistic way to be of service to young people, to see them get access to more than just mental health resources, but healthier food, education?"" And even this past summer, I encountered so many kids who just legitimately so intelligent, so smart. Even more than me, but [inaudible] for them, they don't want to go to school, they don't want to take classes, but it's so... Just tension of seeing the brilliance in them, that the things that they're passionate about, they're so gifted in, but then just having no desire to apply to the certain areas in school, or you even just like... Sometimes high school is just the end. They're like, ""Let me just... I'll finish high school and then whatever happens, happens."" And oftentimes there's not this... They don't often see that path or that way forward. And I think Shamika, you mentioned something earlier about, or maybe I can't remember it was [inaudible], helping these kids finding that hope again. And so being able to say, ""Hey, there is actually a path forward for me to success."" And, yes, if that's [inaudible], but success doesn't have to be limited to getting a bachelor's. Especially in 2021, there are so many different ways that you can find success and make money and be happy and achieve all those goals. So it's really trying to find ways that these teens can actually envision a future. And it did surprise me this summer by hearing just how many of our teens didn't have that plan or even have that thought. And so hoping that in these conversations, and as we elevate more voices and elevate more youth voices, that we can start to bring back some of those things and some of those programs that show our kids and show our community in general, that there is a path forward, there is a way forward.

We know people are not going to live forever, but when... It seems to be a bad thing, just to say ""Hi"" to someone. They are looking at you like, ""What are you speaking to me about? Why are you saying hi to me?"" But I think it starts there with just being friendly neighbors and knowing each other's names. And like you said, ""Being there for each other.""

In terms of that, I think that in Boston, there's like a very covert racism in terms of over racism in terms of other places in the US and it's like a cover-up in terms of like how things are running in Boston specifically in Massachusetts. Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts. I definitely see that resources are not being allocated to students and students are being greatly affected and that's not seen in different parts of Massachusetts. And then, when you look at the demographics within BPS and other school systems within Massachusetts, we see that BPS is predominantly students of color.

I mean how I arrived to this question is just being an educator and just also being a product of the Boston Public School system, graduating and also teaching in the BPS system and teaching different systems and seeing the big difference in terms of like potential for students and how they could get to where they're supposed to be.",roslindale,"['education', 'inequality']","['quality of education', 'race-based', 'class-based']",157.79999999999973,315.59999999999945

But anyway, I grew up in Vermont where, in my high school, that was the first time I was in school with an African-American person in high school. And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close.

I didn't know what I didn't know, and no one showed me and I made a lot of mistakes financially.

No father figure, no uncles, no older brothers. So no real great example of what a male should be and what males need to be doing. So, I would say, the first program was the Paul Robeson Institute and they were located where Ruggles is, so is T accessible. And I won't get in too deep in that. It was an awesome program. It was every Saturday, but you had mentorship and you had apprenticeship. So you could do shop, you could do fashion, you can do whatever it may be and you had an experience.

And the thing about my community, my street, is that we went from families who had lived there for decades, to my street now being very transient. People coming and going, people moving in, moving out. No longer family homes, family dwellings from generation to the next.

But imagine that if we were in that time, when we actually made it a point to get to know people so that your street has an identity, your street has a culture. So that as people are coming in, it's not a chore to convince people to come to neighborhood association meetings, because the first time they see it or hear about it is not when you are shoving a notice in their mailbox, it's because you've actually had a conversation with them and you've mentioned it to them, you've told them about it. So that when it happens, you can say, ""Oh, remember I told you about that meeting, would you like to come with me?"" And I think that we have moved so far... I'm saying ""move."" Maybe we haven't grown or we have dissolved, I'm not even sure what it is, but I just know that we have moved away from that. And I'm just thinking that if we had something that even resembled that... Businesses and organizations survive when they have an infrastructure, right? When they have funds, when they have...

They know what we need. It's not like they don't know what we need. I'll give you a perfect example. Mass Cass. Now, we have this city that is spreading. It's spreading almost like a disease on your skin. You know what I mean? They saw this coming. They've seen it in other cities, and they knew when there was I think 25 tents down there. They saw that. They knew it. They didn't address it. They said they knew there was a problem and they were going to create committees to explore, and they have all these different phrases and things that they use when they want to back you up off of them. So, there's over 200 now. There's a rat infestation there. The community down that way cannot continue to operate. The food pantry is down there. The big food pantry for Boston is down there.

I came from the generation where I heard about the stories about them closing down the polls. My mother and my aunts and uncles and all of them, it wasn't safe.

So, it's really hard to have that across sector collaboration to ensure that would be across the board, because we know that we all have scarce resourcing and we all try to fight for the pie, but not [inaudible] and collaborate, not working together in that context. And then not really involve those who have this experience to be part of that decision making and policy revising or practices that we should be designing as a city or as the officer to be able to do that. So I think a lot of this would be... so if I should go back into the questions, whether or not... how we can hold, that Nan already mentioned, officers accountable in the work that they do? But the big thing for me in terms of how can we ensure that everything is interconnected, and how can we leverage that collaboration, partnership?

And if you continue to operate like this then we are going to remove you. However, we need everybody. We need the blacks. We need the Latinos. We need the Asian. We need the white folks. We need everybody to be saying the same thing to these elected officials because we get it. We know we don't get the services because we don't come out and vote. And that's insane that we continue to ride our bumpy roads, that we continue that we're the last ones getting our trash dump. We can't go through the process of signing up with the City as a vendor for procurement because their process is so long and intimidating that we can't get through it. We don't have organizations that help us with our back office stuff, either be it nonprofit or whether it be a construction worker. We have a lot of construction workers, they have their own businesses, but they don't know how to do the back office stuff. They don't know how to bid on their projects. So they under bid and they don't make any money. I mean, I've seen so much. And I'm telling you, that's what makes me fight and talk the way I do, because I've seen it. I've been in it. And I'm tired of it because it's so unfair. I've been in banking. I worked for the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance helping folks with their first time home buying. Remember when we all got Red Line? I mean, the system continues and continues to beat us down. And who runs the system? White men. Because you have all these white men that are in government that now Washington's been shook up because there's a lot of women coming in, women of color, and that's what we need to do.

There's going to be redistricting, so there's going to be seats up for running. And that's what we need to have. We need to have people that look like us, reflect the synergism and the legislators. Governor Baker doesn't even have a black person on his cabinet. So how are they representing us when he don't even have nobody like us on his cabinet. These are the things that we need to be questioning and then asking them. I asked Michelle Wu, ""Is your cabinet going to look like the people that you serve?"" Because we don't want to go backwards.

Well, we're powerful and everybody know seniors go and vote before anybody else. It's a matter of holding them accountable. And like I'm a lifetime member of the NAACP, and I would go to the conventions, right? And what they do in Washington, they have a report card for everybody in Washington. This is the NAACP national. And I've been saying, ""We need to do that in state, especially Massachusetts."" We need to see what bills they're passing, which ones they're not supporting, and have a record of that, and have it where it's somewhere online or somewhere that the community could go and look at it and form their own opinions, because I think we need to stop telling people who to vote for. We need to tell them you go do your own research and find out. Don't vote for someone because Sarah said you could vote for them. I heard people say, ""Well, Sarah, don't tell them this because they'll go back and say Sarah told me to do this."" So, [inaudible]. But that's my opinion. And that's why I really believe in the voter registration, voter education. Like with my kids, when they turned 18, my nieces and nephews, I would do a voter registration event for all of them that turned 18.

What is their plan to make it even better? I was in a meeting with the schools the other day, with parents asking, ""If you aren't giving me a billion-percent security that my child is not going to get COVID going back to this school, then I don't want it. I would like to go back to the remote model."" And they just keep saying that we need to come to our electorals and tell them what we want. And I'm pretty sure there's been enough parents that have expressed their disapproval of this move, but what do they want? It's almost like those parents that want their kids in school, then go ahead and send your kids.

I don't have children in school at this point, but I do manage staff and a lot of my staff have younger kids at home. So, the expectations from the employer is they can give 100% to their 40 hours, but it's really unrealistic to ask them that if kids are required to stay home and things like that, so it's like a double-edged sword. So, I think it's a huge issue that they're going to have to, overall, really deal with. Personally, I think the hybrid isn't a bad thing because it's a happy medium. And we do have to function and move forward, but there are requirements in place for safety measures.

Oh, I'd say, one was probably about five years old, 10 years old. And one that was 12, 13. And when they stopped at the house, my husband was outside washing his car and, and they said, ""Sir are these free."" And he says, ""Yeah, it's free, take whatever you want.""

And so they said ""Free? Why aren't you selling it?"" I said, ""Well, because I know there are people in the community that could use it."" I mean, there were a lot of clothes that still had the tags on them and everything. So they just said, ""Oh my goodness, our grandmother would love these things."" They were very deliberate and thoughtful in the things that they had picked out. Then this one turned to me and said, ""Miss, do you have any church hats?"" ""I'm sorry that I don't have."" So got them a bag. They left here with so many things. The gratitude and the thoughtfulness of those three young ladies. So they said, ""Well, grandma likes skirts. Do you have any skirts?"" I said, ""Oh, I have plenty of skirts."" So I brought them down. So they even chose a couple of items that they said that they could use as night-shirts. [crosstalk] So the oldest said, ""Are you going to be around tomorrow?"" I said, ""Yes, I will be.""

We need to be secure. And what we get we need to be able to keep it. We need to have something that can't be taken away from us. Like, if we get housing and we buy these houses in the community, I'm concerned about somebody coming in and offering somebody three or four times what their house is worth so that they can blockbust the community. And pretty much like Priscilla was saying with gentrification, when they want it they just come back and take it. We need some protection against that. And, the equality part of that is that it needs to be in the communities of color. Like I said, I live in what's called the West End. It's right next to North End with the Italians. Their equity is passed down through their families, their generations. They keep theirs. So, I worked at Unity Bank back in the day in the 70s and I watched money flowing through Boston. And we had opportunities then for equity. It's about education. We're not educating our young people to say, okay, we don't need those Jordan sneakers, we don't need this that and the other, we need stuff that we're going to be able to pass down to generations.

As a mom, it does concern me because topic about if the city is rushing things, as far as the pandemic. So, that is something that concerns me. I'm glad that they reinstated the mask mandate because, when going out to eat, I was not comfortable seeing servers and people in the kitchen staff handling food. I've witnessed someone sneeze while delivering food to a person, and it just wasn't a comfortable feeling. So, it's nice to see that at least the City of Boston has reintroduced the mandate for mask wearing, whether you're at the grocery store, doctor's office, things like that. So, as far as the Methadone mile, I think it's heartbreaking and it's something that we are all sick of and want some resolution for. I had my own thoughts of what they should do, round them up and bring them back down to the South Shore where they're coming from, because the majority of these people aren't residents in the City of Boston. So, I think that our elective officials really need to meet with the officials and the mayors and things of these other communities because these people are taking resources from the City of Boston.

Firstly, I am a homeowner through one of Boston's programs that help to give affordable homeownership, but I believe like there are some loopholes that stifle our people. When you go through this process, it doesn't allow for advancement. What? It doesn't allow for advancement, they don't have any resources for the homeowners after the purchase, any guidance. And then, as Dorothy had said, they tend to... When you come up with an issue with the house and the quick build of that, money rules the factor of giving these contractors the job to do something, and then they use cheap materials and product. And I don't know if the inspection process part of it is skipped over just to get pushed along just to get the home sold. And then the City's not tentative to the homeowners when they get into a serious situation. And then the reason why you go through that is because of, like what Tarazer said, the pricing, the pay that you make. Half a million dollars for a property that's probably not equal to a half a million dollars' worth of property. And also to piggyback is: are they trying to do what they did in the '60s and move the colored people back onto the outskirts so it's comfortable for the upper class, so to speak, people to be able to access their jobs more easily and make things convenient? It's okay that we share, but be fair. So, don't just push us all out or whatever after we've built up the community and the livelihood of all the neighborhoods and brought that equity back, and now you slyly just push the minority population of the Dorchester Roxbury Mattapan communities out. And I hope that those fears don't come into the homeowners and they stay with their properties, because there's people that come out here like, ""We'll buy your house for X, Y, Z.""

I'm coming back from Syracuse, driving back to my campus and it's myself and my home girl, and we have two Black males in the backseat. It's 2:00 AM. We're going through a small town. It was 35 miles an hour. I think I was going 40. The cop trails us for an mile. And I knew he was behind me. I could see the outline of the car. So I'm slowing down, all this good stuff. He trails for a mile. After mile, he turns on his lights. Again, it's 2:00 AM, upstate New York. It's a very racial, hostile area. So I'm like, this is not going to be good. We got two Black men in the car. I mean, we're all Black. So he pulls us over, 2:00 AM. He says, ""You were driving too fast."" And of course I was already taught, given the talk, you show respect, you show difference. I'm like, sir, we were going 40. I clocked it, all that good stuff. And he's like, well, you're going 40 miles an hour. You could have hit a dog. You could have hit somebody. And I'm like, it's 2:00 AM. Right? And I'm just like, this guy. And he's like, well, let me see your license. Let me see your registration. And then he starts to say, get out of the car. And I'm like, oh God, this is not going to go well. And I'm like, officer. So then I immediately say, because everybody in that are knows the school. I'm like, ""Officer, we're just trying to get back to school. We're trying to get back to Cornell."" And he's like, ""Oh, you go to Cornell?"" Yes, sir. We all go to Cornell. We all didn't. But I was like, we got to get out of this incident. It's 2:00 AM. Nobody is out here. Getting out of the car is not going to be good. So those types of incidences and so for me, it becomes very real when people talk about issues with police and things like that. And I mean, we all saw the George Floyd incident. And even now to this day, I think about it and I get angry just thinking about it. And so it's very real. And so I hear it with the defunding, I connect to it. And at the same time, it creates, as a person, as an ally, I think that's important. But then there's also still that kind of in the back of your head, where you say, you will never understand, truly in the sense of that you will have to have the same conversations with your nieces and nephews or family members, that I have to have with mine. And so, it's like that. Yeah. It's that constant kind of thing. And so I definitely felt your experiences, your sharing of that and I appreciate that.

So many veterans come return home, male and female, with a lot of issues that there should be institutions there to help people resolve their issues of what's now known as PTSD. That wasn't even a channel to turn to, if you will. Over all of our wars as this country, there been no notifications and the name has changed to protect the innocent. But at same time, you did not see the numbers of homelessness that you do now. And again, it's started in a very different time. You also had a situation under I believe, maybe Ronald Reagan, if any youngins can remember that, where the deinstitutionalization of folks who had issues not necessarily war related, but had mental health issues, spiritual issues that were in an essence turned out into the streets. Because the theme at the time is, well, we can find a place for them to come and get their medication. And they can self medicate, and blah, blah, blah, which was absolute down to Coca Cola. Now you move to a time now, where the bottom is beginning to become thicker, because of our social economic situation, Nancy spoke to and please don't misunderstand. But her position as a white person in Boston, even with that, there were prevailing kinds of situations economically, socially, that have now thickened again, the bottom of people who otherwise would not have the same worries or concerns. And how do we take that super huge problem and crystallize it and stop the life out of it, if you will, to bring it to the larger body because the body of people who are falling under that social economic state is growing. And it's including everybody, people who maybe once thought that they were safe.

Actually right when the Long Island shelter was closed, right before the hundred inches of snow that we got that winter and I'm grateful and privileged and blessed to have gotten housing after a few months of that. But I observed like when I go over to doctor's appointments over at BMC or being around methadone bile or mass and cast, as some people call it and the situation has gotten more out in the open and it makes me sad and just disappointed to see people not housed. I know that there's some small group that like to be outside because it's hard to be in a shelter, but I don't feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don't mean just treatment, but having things like there's something called the housing first model where you don't put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, ""You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we'll fill out your verification of homelessness form."" All these things that just make it that much harder. It's harder to be sober when you're out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can't have all the solutions, it's complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I'd like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who've lived here for decades and have been here, I don't like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states.

And now it's like people are telling the people they can't discipline the children anymore. That's making the kids feel like they've got the power. Growing up I didn't have no power. My grandmother told us something and that was it. And then moving forward to the housing, there's no rent control. Every year my rent is going up and I don't understand that, because it just doesn't make sense to me. The people can just keep raising the rent, raising the rent, housing authorities telling you, ""Oh, there's nothing we can do, we're only going to pay you this amount. Or you're going to have to find somewhere else to live."" And then it's like trying to find somewhere else to live is like pulling teeth out of somebody's head with no Novocaine. It's like my voucher is for this much, people aren't even accepting this price anymore for housing. It's ridiculous. And then as far as the homeless people in the world right now, it's getting cold outside and I really feel for them, because right now it's freezing. And what are we supposed to do. Yes, we're complaining about rent control and housing and stuff. We've got a roof over our head. At the same time, someone else doesn't. And that hurts me, but I still have concerns as a resident also. And as far as April, as far as the people building condos and housing everywhere. That's concerning too, because it's like okay, what are we going to do. We just wait our turn to be pushed out? Or what are they going to tell us? We've got to go? I don't know how that works. A lot of things now are different. Before, we didn't have to worry about these things. Even the pandemic. Even Covid, Delta, our children are growing up in different times now.

And it's complicated like someone said, the world is so divided, but at the same time, we do need to be more, I agree with being more involved in the kids' schools because you don't know what's going on over there. My son is five years old and I went to the school. They had a meeting with me, because he has autism. He was pulling his pants down and urinating on the floor. So, I'm like, ""Okay, that doesn't sound right, because when he's at home he is not doing it, he goes to the bathroom and he wears underwear."" So, for school I didn't feel comfortable just putting him out in school in underwear so I sent him in pull ups. And they were all like, ""He needs to be in underwear since he wears underwear at home, he should be in underwear at school."" I was like, ""I don't think that's a good idea."" Because, I think it's too fast. He is not familiar with his surroundings yet, he doesn't know. But people don't think that we know our children and that we don't know what's best for them, because they have degrees and these things and that they know better than we do, but if we've been with our children ever since they've been born. We know our child more than anyone else can think that they know them. So, I did what they said and I put him in underwear and I sent him to the school. And I set my son up for failure, because then he's in an uncomfortable situation. He doesn't know if this is comfortable for him or not. So, he ended up pulling his pants down and stuff. So, then they ended up wanting to have a meeting with me. So, I ended up having the meeting with them. And then I'm like, ""Let me see what this bathroom looks like, let me see."" Because, my son has a problem with using public restroom, so I go in the bathroom and I walk into the classroom and the classroom is so depressing. As soon as I went in the class, it was a whole depression came over me or something. It was dark in the class. I forgot where I was at. And I'm like, ""Damn, open up some of the windows, the shades and stuff, why is it so dark in here?"" And so I walked into the bathroom to see if he'll go and the bathroom was so dark and scary. It looked like it was a dungeon or something. I'm like, ""No wonder why these kids is in here acting up, they're in a developmental class and it's depressing as hell in here. Come on. No wonder why they're acting up. Open up the damn shades. Put the light on in the bathroom. God said let there be light, come on. Get it together in here."" I'm like, ""Oh my god, I didn't even know."" I felt something as soon as I went in there and I was uncomfortable. And I didn't like that so I took my son home for the day, because as soon as I went back in the room to talk with the teacher and then they said my son was knocking shelves off of the wall. So, I'm like, ""Yeah, you're going home for the rest of the day."" They were trying to kick him out of school.

I don't know what's going to happen, because I don't know if anybody can afford to live here. The taxes are ridiculous here. So, people are moving out. I've questioned whether should I still stay here. I used to walk from my house to Tufts Medical Center when my mother got sick. I cannot walk from my house to Tufts Medical Center anymore because I'm scared to. And remember, I'm 47, so I grew up in the '90s and I wasn't scared of anything. I could walk up and down Washington Street and walk everywhere and walk downtown. But I'm scared now, because of Mass and Cass. I can't walk through the side streets anymore. I would not dare do that. So if there was something that we could do to find out if we could get those three bedrooms, but everything that they're building right now doesn't even have a three bedroom attached to it. It's always a loft or they're building $500,000 condos or lofts. They're splitting that. They're buying houses up around the neighborhood because now it's for cash, and a lot of the families have moved out. So, they're selling them, unfortunately, and they're splitting the houses. Put them in two or three family houses. They're splitting them into $500,000 condos or lofts now.",roxbury,"['community trends', 'housing']","['unjust', 'belonging', 'fear', 'gentrification and displacement', 'housing affordability', 'housing quality']",176.10000000000014,352.2000000000003

The way I describe it to people is, it's pretty much a program that prepares you to take a test to then get to some type of private school outside of Boston. And that's what I did and I was able to get into a school in Chestnut Hill, Beaver Country Day School. And I spent six till 12 grade there. So my experiences are very different, but I know being one of five kids who went to that school, who were actually from Boston, that it's not easy. The experiences I had going to that school really molded me because it's kind of like I had an inside view into what private schools are like and what kids who have the resources from their parents and just their communities look at what they have to do versus us who have to pretty much prove ourselves constantly and fight for everything that we want to be able to stay within the conversation.

And within that group, we share our pain, our struggle to be equal, and I found a certain level of peace from losing my son. When I lost my son, I had vowed to give back to the community because they gave to me. And we were very fortunate in that respect.

We knew about it, and she had treatment along the way. He was a complete surprise. He passed away subsequently after hospitalization on Mother's Day. My relationship with my ex did not last. My relationship with myself was suppressed.

It's not like you see a lot of friendly faces anymore, you see people, they're like, ""Ra."" So, it's like you'll just be scared. People are not really sensitive anymore. A lot of people are just cold and bitter now. I don't know, I remember growing up I've seen a whole bunch of jolly faces, happy people. People were happy. People were content with who they were and they were just, they just loved everyone. My grandmother, she raised us and stuff. And we was in a three family house and stuff on Crawford Street. That's where we grew up at, in Grove Hall. And everybody knew everybody. Everybody just knew everybody and it was good. Now it's like everybody is divided. They don't want to know nobody and that makes you scared. I'm not going to trust somebody with my child that don't look too friendly. So, it's just everybody is divided, everybody is all about self. And then they wonder why these kids are out here shooting each other. These kids are out here getting into all of this stuff, probably because they can't relate to their own people and their own house. They need someone else to talk to. Maybe someone else, if you can't get them on the right track, maybe someone else can. That's how it was. If I couldn't talk to my mom about something, I had my aunt. If I couldn't talk to my aunt about something, I had my other aunt or my uncle, I always had someone I could go to and talk to.

The Twins were in 5th grade in an advance work program and because they were twins, they were placed in different classes, which is partly my hope that they wouldn't live as twins, that they would have their own lives. So they were placed in different classes and because of that, they had different teachers the year before they were supposed to go to where they would go to high school. I guess that was middle school. Sorry. That must have been fifth grade just before the sixth grade. And so, one of the twins went Boston Latin and the other one to Boston Latin Academy because of the teachers they had because the one who went to Boston Latin Academy had the really tough teacher who felt that she needed to treat all the kids as though they were in boot camp. And so she was really tough on them and the parents all complained the kids are getting ulcers, they are having nightmares and everything. Like it was really hard for the kids and because of that, one of my sons went to this school, one of my sons went to that school. I imagine their capabilities are comparable but I can see how it happens that because of a small difference, one goes this way and one goes that way. And certainly when there are much bigger differences, including the color of your skin and the way you speak and how much your parents were able to invest in your education, I mean, reading you stories when you were an infant or even in the womb or whatever. It's so important that the public school be the place where everybody gets what they need and I'm grateful that you're there.",roxbury,"['community trends', 'education']","['belonging', 'hopeful', 'quality of education']",156.19999999999982,312.39999999999964

We have some dysfunctional pain and unmet trauma, post-traumatic stuff.

It marginalized people of color, it marginalized women, marginalized LGBTQ, all that youth. And I think education is a source of all opportunity and all growth and all wealth. So I speak from my experience, because I had the opportunity to sit in a meeting with Arne Duncan, who is the former Secretary of Education. And this was a meeting where students from all across the country, we sat down, we talked with him. And we just got to talk, what is our education system looking like? And I'm from Boston, Harvard's down the sheet, Wentworth, MIT, all these schools.

How to cook for yourself? How to buy a car? How to do these things? Why does our family members have to do this on our own and teach and teach us when."" I feel it makes sense in education system, we should be learning that specific fact. I mean, the weather cycle is great and all, but teach the foundations of life first and then you can proceed to electives as in like, language and... I mean, language is of course important but teach stuff on first. And it's interesting because I think that that's something education is once we're going to do it, you have to be a public school, or a private school, or a charter school to start your own curriculum. But I think that it's important to start teaching, especially Black and Brown youth, we shouldn't wait until you're in your 20s to start learning about finance.

And I feel we see a lot of buildings and affordable housing units and all these things being pop up, but the demand for is still not being met. So my personal experience is I entered the lottery for one of these new buildings, and the lotteries through the city, but then once you get accepted, it then gets pushed to the property management company. And the property management companies have tactics in place to deter folks from actually being placed within those units. So what accountability measures are being placed for a program that's being funded by the taxpayers, that's being built by the city, and all these different things, and it's just like the ball is passed to folks that are not managing it appropriately. And in a space where there's a lot of just disorganization, and they're not being honest about things. And they're saying, ""Oh, this person's rejecting it, and not creating a full picture."" We're never going to be able to meet the demand. If the folks that you were doing business with, you're not making it clear to them that this is your expectation. And if you don't meet the expectation, the result is you will no longer have a contract as a property management company. And I feel just all around, there's just no accountability period for anyone. Folks just get to do what they want to do, they put a really great picture on, they write eloquent words, they create this whole pie chart and graphs without actually implementing any other measures or showing all the progress that was made. And no one goes back and says, ""Well, we know we want to be able to audit your paperwork, we want to be able to see what it is that you're doing.

I was a single mom, make sure he was able to go into programs and go to community centers and stuff like that. But I got to work in order for him to do that. You know what I mean? And the centers wasn't cheap. The program wasn't cheap. And me, because I couldn't afford education, [inaudible] had the money for it, my years and... So there's another question, education versus years and your position. If I got the experience, years of experience, but I don't have the education, when does that going to count again? Just because somebody was able to afford a education doesn't mean that they have knowledge and understanding or understand the population that they're dealing with. So I couldn't get those high paying jobs, because didn't had a education, but I had the experience, you know what I mean? So it goes all the way back to the affordable housing, I would be content, if I didn't have to raise my child and make sure he was equipped. If I didn't have to work two jobs, it's hard trying to juggle school work and your child, you know what I mean? So, I think we need to bring back affordable housing which is really affordable to middle class people, working people because when you are working, in my experience, you can't get certain benefits, you can't get TAFDC, you can't get food stamps, snap as you all call it benefits anymore, because you are overqualified. You have to qualify first before you can get this snap. And so stuff like that helps and it benefits your child.

Obviously, when I was growing up, I didn't care where I lived, it was whatever it was good enough for me. But we moved from our apartment to a house. And that in and of itself, was the greatest thing for my family. It's now we have a house. And the idea of home ownership. I don't think people in the inner city understand that. You can literally, if you are a good parent, you can be looking at your children, and they won't see the suburbs or the rural areas and be like, ""I want that."" Though we see on TV, and understand that that's the life, but they won't look up to you and be like, ""We need to have a house."" But you are thinking, ""We need a house. This is what I want. I want to create generational wealth."" And that's something that I think people in my circle didn't grow up with that idea. It was just everything's here, we have an apartment, we have our household, we have education. But the idea of now getting affordable housing is something that is coming to the forefront of my mind. And how do you make sense of getting affordable housing? Where's the right place to do it? And thinking about not just getting a house but if you want to have a family, how do you now choose the right location for a school. How do you choose it, where you have good hospitals near you? And I think it's something that goes back to education, not just finances, though we need to understand how does housing happen? How do you make sure someone is held accountable if they're not hiring their friends to get this in the housing? How do you make sure everything connects and fits. And that's why I take it back to education, because if we're not just learning about 400 years of history, or the weather cyber, which is sometimes... It's important, but if we all are at the same understanding of what is going on our society, and I think you've talked about civic engagement. Voting, we don't talk about that in school at all. And it doesn't make any sense because there are so... You'll see signs of this mayor, this person for councilor, it's like, ""Who is this person?"" We're seeing these people every single day, but you don't understand your role. And I think it's also how to not only accountability for people who are in places in power, but how do we take accountability for ourselves, because we are citizens who have so much power. We have the power to vote, but not only that, we have the power to learn and make active change, to create community spaces, sit down and do it. But how do we understand our role? And it's because we're not taught at all. We're not taught that we have one. And we need to know that we do have one.",roxbury,"['institutions', 'housing', 'education']","['expectations', 'accountability', 'homeownership', 'housing affordability', 'quality of education']",210.5,421.0

So when I was growing up, when we first came to America from Haiti, my parents, we lived in Everett. And so I went to the Everett school systems. And once you get to high school, there was actually... Everett Cooperative Bank is within the high school. And that was a class that you take. And I took the class for two years. And so you go through the class, they teach you everything about banking, you actually do banking within the schools, kids have accounts and all that, once you graduate, they then position you into the actual branch outside, where you now have a job as you graduate, and you're going through the whole banking system. And so that's something that since in Boston, I've been trying to figure out every corner you turn around, there's a bank, somewhere, but I don't see that being implemented at all. And a big question for me is that we've been talking about entrepreneurs and businesses and loans, but there hasn't been any discussions on personal. You're building these homes, you're building these spaces, we can't afford them because we can't get loans. So where's the disconnect? Where are the conversations that are being had to know that everything is interconnected? So if you want us to be able to access the generational wealth, typically, in order for us to access it, we need to get a loan in order for us to make that purchase. And we know that through the banking system, it's very predatory practices, it's just absolute. Structural racism within the banking system is just out of this world. And I think that that's one of the ways that we need to make sure that we can start to attack some of the challenges and issues that we're having in our communities, you see more check cashing places than you actually see banks. And then the banks that are opened, there's no sense of community, you can't go in there, there's no one that really knows your name, no one's actually sitting there to try to figure out what they can screen you for, what products they have that would work for you. It's just taking your money and then not investing into any of the programming around you. And investing in anything that's beneficial for you. But meanwhile, you're giving them your hard earned funds constantly. And that's something that I would really love to see an elected, at least try to acknowledge or convene the banking systems in all the different places that we have, to start to have conversations on how do they better approach people of color, and making sure that the products that they have available work for us, and if our credit scores are not good enough, or we're not meeting the requirements, what programs do you have in place to help us get there? How can you usher us into a new space where we can walk into your space, and be able to say, ""I'd like a loan, please."" Actually, we don't even need to be able to ask for a loan, you should be coming to us because you go everywhere else, and you send fliers to X, Y and Z and you say, ""You're pre approved for this amount of money."" But how do we improve that line of communication and the ability for us to feel we can go to banks and be able to access the funds like we know a lot of other people can.",roxbury,"['community trends', 'institutions', 'housing', 'community life', 'education', 'economic opportunity', 'inequality']","['belonging', 'lack of action', 'expectations', 'homeownership', 'housing affordability', 'call to action', 'community relationships', 'community values', 'life skills', 'financial literacy', 'race-based', 'foreign-born']",202.19999999999982,404.39999999999964

And then there were three people of color in my whole high school and they were the same family. One of their name was Washington and they weren't in my class, of course, but I come from a long line of New England- You cut off. You're off. You put mute by mistake. You said you come from a long line of? Of Quakers, New England people. So clearly my philosophy, having come of age in the time of the civil rights like, oh, I didn't know that was a problem, but of course yeah, everybody's equal. I mean, I don't know any people who are different from me, but yeah that makes sense. So I didn't really have that real life experience. Of course, my ancestors are privileged and therefore, we know that they've benefited from slavery and all those things, but I didn't know anything about that, so you could call me innocent I suppose in the naive sense of the word. But now, of course, I've been here, I've been in Boston since 1972. That's a long time and I have a lot of experience. So this afternoon when I was out walking, I should say I live maybe a half mile from Nubian Square and so, I walked out bound toward Nubian Square through Nubian square, and then kept going. So, I did a big loop going down Blue Hill Avenue coming back on Warren Avenue, and I see lots of people and many of those people are averting their eyes when they get close.

When a developer comes in and wants to develop on public land owned by the city, and they want federal or state, or city tax credits, you don't get them unless we come up with a plan to make sure that there's packages of housing, for one, two, three, four, five room housing.""

I hadn't ever thought of it until I'll say probably the past 20 years. And again, I've been in Boston since 1970. And once I graduated high school and college and started working and having children, and I have three adult children and I have three grandchildren as well. And I've just been thinking of it lately because where I live, I live in a complex of 60 town homes, and the management company that works for us, supposedly, they're so unprofessional. They're just so... I would say slumlords if they were our landlords, but I don't call them landlords because they're a management company, but they're the worst. They're so unprofessional. They can't keep a maintenance team together for two seconds. It's just a mess. And I often think, ""If I owned my home or co-owned my home, we wouldn't have to deal with waiting for this or them coming to do this or that."" And I'll admit, I've been a section eight recipient since 1974, 1972 actually, when I moved out from my mom's home. And I've been able to maintain that, thank God, and live in Boston. Of course, the rents are just through the roof, as you all know, but home-ownership, I've been thinking about it lately, Carmen, and I have a son-in-law that he was a vet. I mean, he fought in the army and now he works for the state, and I've just been saying, ""Buy something so that we can co-own. Buy a home or have it built and build me a little, how they call it, the in-law home, or in-law unit next to it or near it. And that way you can receive the rent that I pay, the rent that the state, this year, that they pay as well."" But he's, for some reason, not wanting to do that. But just home-ownership would be so great because you have so much more of a say so in making your home as comfortable as you want it, instead of having to wait and go through the headache of people that aren't doing what they're supposed to do. So I live here right in Dorchester, and I've always thought home-ownership should be out in the suburbs somewhere. But no, I'd love to own a home right here somewhere in Dorchester, because I lived in Dorchester, Mattapan, since I've been in Boston, and I just love it. I don't always love what's going on outside of my door, but I love Dorchester, I really do. And I'd like to own a home here and the homes that they have here just cost so much. I don't foresee that happening, but I'm onboard with you, Carmen. I'd love to be a homeowner. I think we all should be homeowners if we could, but I know that's not...

I just read, in the Boston Globe yesterday, that Black teachers hardly exist in Boston anymore. So all that work that Judge [Garrity] did, to actually call for a one on one hiring, and to bring up the level of Black teachers, to be at the same level of the population of students, which was at the time around 23, 24%, everything has changed and nothing has changed in Boston, in terms of educational opportunity for Black folks.

So it's clear, it's a unified conversation that needs to be had, probably everybody on this call, but they can speak for themselves, has been impacted by gentrification. I know that my grandfather, who came from Barbados, in the early 1900s, bought a house on [Stromard] Avenue, and was gentrified out, in the 1980s. After having a house, well, it was his daughter, my mother, who actually received the house after he passed away, but she was gentrified out because it became unaffordable for her to live there, because of taxes. Now it's a multimillion dollar home, on the corner of Stromard and Massachusetts Avenue. As I said, five generations of Rocks have lived over and impacted in that house, and unfortunately, it's gone now.

And I think that, unfortunately, something that has come up with a lot with people who are return citizens from incarceration, [inaudible], but then also just people my age in general, is that there's not that much information out there that's really accurate. All the information that you're getting is for certain political parties, or for certain people, and so it's biased.

So it's clear, it's a unified conversation that needs to be had, probably everybody on this call, but they can speak for themselves, has been impacted by gentrification. I know that my grandfather, who came from Barbados, in the early 1900s, bought a house on [Stromard] Avenue, and was gentrified out, in the 1980s. After having a house, well, it was his daughter, my mother, who actually received the house after he passed away, but she was gentrified out because it became unaffordable for her to live there, because of taxes. Now it's a multimillion dollar home, on the corner of Stromard and Massachusetts Avenue. As I said, five generations of Rocks have lived over and impacted in that house, and unfortunately, it's gone now.

A lot of people were in the room, and they were talking about a framework to be able...

And I've taken language classes and I keep telling people I struggle with English, but I think it's amazing and it upsets me that it is not celebrated, it is not considered one of the great benefits of Boston.

I would like to say there is something called NACA, naca.com, which is a low income... Helps low income, low and middle income people buy houses. So just, people can look at that. We're smart and interestingly, we were able to buy the house way back when, under its previous incarnation, so I know about them. But going back to that kind of idea that I never thought... I know people choose to rent as opposed to buying houses, but that was always the default for me, is to buy a house. So I find that kind of interesting.

But the problem with the housing issue that both of us faced is really the same that Boston does not have a lot of housing stock and the housing stock they're building is not going to help, because it doesn't serve families, and children, especially, these high rises are very dangerous for children. There's nowhere for them to play and so forth, so the housing issue still is critical to many groups of people whether they're homeowners or tenants, whether they're young, or old, or retired, or students, we all are vying for the same piece of the pie here. And the pie is very small to begin with, because this is a small town and this is the problem. Boston has always been a small town and we've always been somewhat in denial about it. And the problem now is, is because the other issue involving construction has reduced the amount of green space. I didn't bring that up, which also is going to contribute to the adverse effects of climate change, because we have fewer trees here, we have a heat sink here in Allston because of the amount of concrete it's going to raise the temperature, that's going to use more electricity, more energy. So, we're making it worse, and at the same time, we're looking at thousands of students pouring back into the city in another few weeks and they're going to be looking for housing.

I don't think people understood the law actually, which is why they voted it out.

Single-family house. Is that because you assume it's cheaper somewhere else than Boston? Well, it probably is, but no, that's not the only reason, I have the business to consider. There are many issues, security issues surrounding the business that I have to deal with. And also my commercial. I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand what you mean by security issues surrounding the business [crosstalk]? My inventory's worth a great deal of money.

But also the crime has increased, we are, according to the police report, there were 12 break-ins in the Brighton Center area just last weekend. This is another concern. So, it's a whole bunch of issues really, but they all point in the same direction, frankly, that I need to leave. And do you have any particular town or city you're thinking of [crosstalk] to? Well, actually, somebody suggested Lowell, because of the art scene. I don't know, I do know someone who has property there, but it's not a single-family house, so I don't know.

Oh, yeah. Michael, I wouldn't even consider doing it here anymore. Not only because... [crosstalk] It's because... Here's the problem that we're facing. This gets into politics, and voting, that's another issue I wanted to talk about, but the problem here is that I walked through Brighton every day on my way to work and home after home is no longer a single-owner home.

When I talk about my story, it's painful, it's like reliving trauma. I talk about the times being spit on by drunken white boys and go on to Cub Scout when I was nine years old. That's painful to talk about, because I could still smell the liquor in the spit, which has a bad smell. I mean, I talk about being a young kid growing up in Mission Hill running a major community center and was initiated with Charles Stuart murder when a pregnant white woman was alleged killed by a black man, and those are all a hunt for every black men, civil rights savagely violated, pants pulled down in front of the center, I was going to become the director, couldn't happen to me. That's painful, so I can go on and on. One of the officials in that year, when we started dunk the boat doing a couple of years later in 1992, one of the officials was my brother who was murdered on Christmas Day in 1992. So, when you talk about stories, and then you're asking people to come tell this story, that brings knowledge to those who are collecting it and look at us as being experiments. So, I think it's important that we compensate when we talk about equity, when we talk about reaching people that have been overlooked, mistreated, literally written off, and then you're asking them to relive that experience, it's painful. So, that's why I was hesitant. And you're going to hear many stories like that, and it is traumatic to go through this. I'm sitting here with people that I love, I'm sitting here with people that I trust, but it's still painful to even talk about what I'm experiencing. So, that's why I was hesitant in telling that story. So, as I continue with this project, and as I talked to my staff and those that are part of this campaign, take into consideration that people are dealing with a lot of stuff, whether it's health, whether it's poverty, and whether they feel comfortable being able to tell this story. The people that don't look like them, that they don't trust, that they don't want to tell their business, that they don't want to hear from them how to be black, and what we need.

As I mentioned, I'm driving my family around all the time, which includes my 90-year-old father who grew up in Boston. And I've been doing a lot on Zoom, various things. So there are three parts of that that I wanted bring up in the experience. So last year I did some program at the Mass Historical Society on voting during a pandemic. And in the middle of that, one of the things in that is they talked about how James Michael Curley, if anybody's been in by Faneuil Hall, you see the statue of him, how James Michael Curley and Honey Fitzgerald, who was mayor of Boston and the grandfather of John F. Kennedy, had this real fight and they actually changed the law at that point. So James Michael Curley, who was mayor of Boston, could not have consecutive term. I thought that was hysterical. My father's a history buff and so I talked to him about that while I was driving him over to his appointment, I don't know, over there. Please don't even ask me which hospital it was at that point. And oh, and he said, ""Oh yeah, my father used to work on James Michael Curley's campaigns."" And I'm like, ""What?"" I was completely amazed. And he told me the story about my great-uncle was at a Curley rally and Curley pointed to him and said, ""You, Kid, you look cold."" And he gave him the coat off his back. And so that coat stuck around the family for years. We later found out, when I looked into this whole thing, that he actually used to keep coats in his car, so every rally he would do, he would take his coat off and give it to some kid in the group. But anyway, it turned my family into like standout campaigns and everything like that. About the same time I drove my father over to his appointment and we're coming back through Mission Hill, and he's pointing out where his grandparents had lived before they moved to Roxbury. And then he kind of muttered off his oldest brother who was kind of the black sheep of the family, he said, ""Jimmy never left Mission Hill."" So I started thinking about those things and there were a number of other things. It's like my father, when they were doing busing, the early meetings on busing, we were in the public school and the reason my parents actually took us out of the public school was because my father went to every meeting, and he kept telling people that this tract of area, that they had no houses on, the map they were living that they had was... His house was in the middle of it and he had six kids. And they kept saying, ""We'll figure it out when the time comes."" And his whole attitude was, ""Well, we're not going to figure it out.

Now they came up with this term called affordable housing, which is actually a developers term and what it amounts to is a slight reduction of rent for a year. Now, that's not really going to help a lot of people in the long run, but it provided the developers with an excuse who I erect here in my part of towns, literally hundreds of high rises, which is going to have a completely disastrous effect in terms of climate change issues in the near future, and the delivery of city services, including water and sewer, electric service is going to be deteriorated because every source has already said they don't want to provide more equipment.

You also walked away with the projects, so is a project based program and everybody in there, I still interact with on certain levels. Keith Motley was one of the head organizers. I think he was at UMass last, I don't know what's going on with brother Motley but that's what I'm saying. You still have brother Motley doing a lot of things throughout the city of Boston, and I can pick up the phone and call him. I have people like you from the Chica Project. We need more catalysts like that and that is the reason why I've been able to be successful, and I am currently the operations manager for Zuma Boston in the Four Seasons Dalton like you can't do that.

And I think if you look at the history of Boston, just the small history of Boston over the past say maybe even since 19, what are we talking, 60, maybe 1960, so maybe about 60 years and 50 somehow years, if we look at that, we look at the race rights, we look at desegregation, we look at all the things that started, we look at the structures that how desegregation came out of Boston, we look at the people who did that, we look at the communities that came out of... we look at the assassination of Martin Luther King, and then we look at Boston's history of redlining and how they destroyed the West End, and how they then took Roxbury... just everything that's been done here. The things that were done in the South End. I mean, I think one of the things that Markeisha was talking about was the destruction of the West End where Mel King grew up, right? There was three jails there. When they destroyed the West End it had poor Irish, poor Italian, and poor Jews, and poor blacks. By the time it was destroyed and whites were allowed now or those three ethnic groups were now been seen as being white and no longer just ethnic groups of poor Italian, poor Irish, and poor Jew, they are now white, and they were able to leave the black community. And when I grew through the 60s, 70s, and 80s, I can remember smelling burning houses, and I can remember people talking about wetting their roofs so that ember from other houses that were going to be set on fire by people who were never moving back to the neighborhood, and would never sell their property as well, those are the same properties that are now along the Blue Hill half-quarter, all the way from lower Roxbury all the way into Mattapan Square to Milton. So, this has been my experience growing up here in Massachusetts and seeing this, the powers at be, the same structures exist. It's the same story that the queen was talking about, people deciding now that people with color who could only live in Roxbury now can live in Stoughton and Thornton and all these other places, but Roxbury is now the place where they should be.

I mean, I was real mad and angry, even though I was a leader of the Brookline Tenant Union, coordinated the entire towns' election and all the 20 precincts, and I just felt powerless and just left and contested. Anyway, a couple of years later, in '95 or '96, I was renting in Jamaica Plain, and a friend of mine [Chrissolio] who had become a realtor, who I knew from years ago, told me about this first-time home buyers program that the city ran. That if you went to this class downtown you could get a $2,000 grant or loan that would turn into a grant from the city to buy a home if you were a first-time home buyer. And it was for low-income people, which I wasn't making a lot of money at the time so I qualified. And so, I went through this, got the thing, and I found an apartment, 94 Forest Hills Street, in Jamaica Plain, for $72,000 and was able to buy it through this first-time home buyers thing. I got a grant, I got a special, soft second mortgage through the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance and bought this place. And I lived there for several years. Later, Jessica and I got married, we moved to Arlington, I still own it.

Firstly, I am a homeowner through one of Boston's programs that help to give affordable homeownership, but I believe like there are some loopholes that stifle our people. When you go through this process, it doesn't allow for advancement. What? It doesn't allow for advancement, they don't have any resources for the homeowners after the purchase, any guidance. And then, as Dorothy had said, they tend to... When you come up with an issue with the house and the quick build of that, money rules the factor of giving these contractors the job to do something, and then they use cheap materials and product. And I don't know if the inspection process part of it is skipped over just to get pushed along just to get the home sold. And then the City's not tentative to the homeowners when they get into a serious situation. And then the reason why you go through that is because of, like what Tarazer said, the pricing, the pay that you make. Half a million dollars for a property that's probably not equal to a half a million dollars' worth of property. And also to piggyback is: are they trying to do what they did in the '60s and move the colored people back onto the outskirts so it's comfortable for the upper class, so to speak, people to be able to access their jobs more easily and make things convenient? It's okay that we share, but be fair.

Well, there's a big question, is, the government responds, based on voting. And if Black folks aren't coming out to vote, and if people that are running for election are not motivating folks to get out and vote, both in their conversations, speeches about what they plan to do, what plans they have, then the status quo is going to be the status quo. And the bottom line is, those that do vote, should actually coil all this together, and have those conversations with the body politicians, to essentially say, ""Guess what? When a developer comes in and wants to develop on public land owned by the city, and they want federal or state, or city tax credits, you don't get them unless we come up with a plan to make sure that there's packages of housing, for one, two, three, four, five room housing."" Because you know, Black families and Latino families are large. But they're making apartment buildings with one bedrooms and efficiencies, so that automatically forces people out, particularly those that can't afford that market rate housing. So if there's no strategy to make sure that the developers and the city, is requiring a certain number of properties made out for families... But there's not that conversation in the city, at all. None of the politicians are talking that language. To me, conversation just for pretty conversation, is nothing.

Seeing the way that the city highlights gentrification as a positive thing, has been something that's been on my mind, just because seeing the brochures for these newer housing complexes and stuff and it's just like, ""It's like newly gentrified neighborhood"", you know what I mean? So now I'm like, [inaudible]. But you know what I mean? Yeah, connotation and context is super important, like as far as the communities go. But I definitely resonate with the stories that you both shared. Obviously, as someone who lived in Roxbury and Grove Hall, my entire life and now I'm living in the North End, because it's more affordable than where I used to live, is like that's a direct result of the ways that my community is currently and has been gentrified. I think that it's important also to recognize that for many different people, their circumstances are different. You know what I mean? We have different lived experiences and different like economic, we have different I guess ideas of economic stability and lived experiences with that, as well. So my story is like very different from a lot of other people's, but being someone who is the youngest and I never take youngest sibling, you know what I mean, like slander, because I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. But yeah, you know what I mean? Like being the youngest of a household of four children, two of whom were like adopted. It's like, kind of the idea of community that I share, or that I have and that I hold dear, is like very different than a lot of other people. I definitely think that seeing the gentrification that's taking place right now, it's very reminiscent of how the community kind of felt very disparate when I was younger, do you know what I mean? Because, you have people that you're close to, you have your kind of blood relatives and your blood family members and stuff like that. But then you also have these like adopted family members who are like, you want to care about and who are like they're a part of your family and you go to love them and stuff like that. You know what I mean? That's your brothers, your sisters. You feel me? But at the end of the day it's like, there's still always going to be a divide. You know what I mean? I feel like the people that are moving into the neighborhoods, they're not to blame for the gentrification that's taking place. It's more so around the foundations that are being laid by the city to be able to have those people move in. You know what I mean? I think that divide is something that happens a lot. I saw that happen like my own household, just like with adopted siblings and myself. You know what I mean, with my birth mom and sister, it's just like, it's easy for us to fight each other and kind of not like each other, because it's like, ""Oh you're this and this and you know whatever."" But it's not really conducive to an environment that we can all grow and thrive in. You feel me? Like there can be like space for people to be able to live in affordable housing and I mean there can be [inaudible] folks who are, you know what I mean? Like whether they're a part of the artist community or they're a part of the business community, whatever, to be able to find space. Because there shouldn't be that, like one group of people shouldn't be pushed out for another group of people to be able to thrive. You feel me? I feel like until the city has that in mind, so that concept gets through their skulls, we're not going to be able to have a clear understanding of who, of what community actually feels like.

Our prime example is the Boston Public School system. I teach in the BPS system. I've been teaching for seven years. I used to be a teacher at a charter school, and now I'm in the BPS system. And I see the big difference in terms of just how schools are run differently and given that BPS is the oldest institution within the United States and also, the biggest public school system within Massachusetts.

I just read, in the Boston Globe yesterday, that Black teachers hardly exist in Boston anymore. So all that work that Judge [Garrity] did, to actually call for a one on one hiring, and to bring up the level of Black teachers, to be at the same level of the population of students, which was at the time around 23, 24%, everything has changed and nothing has changed in Boston, in terms of educational opportunity for Black folks. And I'm going to put in people of color, and I'm going to talk about poor Whites too, that their parents jumped and ran and moved out, but some weren't able to move out, and they're still there, and the kids are getting the same lack of educational opportunities.

I think about this Boston that so many people admire, you watch the news and you see all the college students moving in to Boston, all over to go to school and you heat the parent on the news, talking about helping their child move in to go to school from Boston, because Boston has the best fist. We're leading in education, we have the best colleges and universities. Even Boston, Boston was promoted on Grey's Anatomy. The medical institutions down here was promoted on shows and other shows, but was promoted on stuff like Grey's Anatomy, Boston.

So there's benefits, but there's a lot of traumas in our community and a lot of trauma in Boston. There's just healing that needs to happen.

Instead of being divisive, the same people that say we need to work together are the same people that are marginalizing other people and it's frustrating.

Then they just all laughed. I heard the clinking of beers and they just drove off really fast and just like, that made me think of that. So I connected briefly in that moment to that. Then just like overall, about the schooling and what you were saying earlier, Bianca, about just the really big differences in the schooling and I think a lot about how like other of my peers, who also did get held back, didn't stay. They were just like, ""All right, if I'm going to get held back, then I might as well stay home, or I'll just go to another school where they don't even take attendance.""

I remember seeing the news and seeing my friend Rudy, who I knew was in foster care and stuff, he was in a shoot out with the police in like 2016 and he passed away as a result. I knew that his attendance was really bad, back in elementary school. So schooling has a huge impact on how a youth's life can turn out as an adult. Racism also, has a huge impact on how a youth can turn out as an adult. So you know, these are institutions of inequality. They were made this way for an original purpose that we could argue back and forth on for hours, but it's a matter of fact that our youth are getting harmed, in school and outside of school, on the way to playing games and stuff like that and not everybody can just tough it out and just whatever, pull them up by these imaginary bootstraps that we keep hearing about.

And in that class, it talked about somewhat like privilege, right? So what I learned was that white people are minorities. I said, ""Okay, so you tell me how that different from a urban community who majority are minorities."" So what I was informed is because they don't have access to a lot of different resources because they make a dollar more or a hundred dollars more, or $2,000 more. And so that's why they don't qualify for a lot of services or resources that is around. And so what I want to say in the urban community or overall across the state or the state that they reside in. And so when I learned that I had to go back and kind of really, really dig in, like, okay... So for the household, if it's a household family, two parents in the household, yes, their income is going to escalate, right? And so maybe that one person, one of the members who is the breadwinner, maybe something happens along the way. And then, so they still minimize all the resources they can get they're entitled to because maybe the other member of the household who was the half of the breadwinner still makes too much money because they make over 60, 70,000 a year, right? So because of that, they still not entitled, but they did become minorities. That's complicated. So it's so complicated because who set the barriers of what these words mean? Where it comes from? Where does it resonate from? Mm-hmm (affirmative). So that's what I find such a differ in how you classify Caucasian or white, black, however you want to put it, black, brown, and beige. I put the beige in there because all of us, we all come in different formations. I ain't going to say different colors because I don't believe in colors, even though I could be wrong. How I identify? I identify as who I am. Everybody can identify who they are as an individual, but we all come from the same place. I don't care if you're black, brown, Asian, don't matter.

And sometimes I feel it's who you know in terms of getting the resources that people need because they're not advertised as much as I think they should be. For me, I was once, and in certain areas I still am a recipient of various resources that the city has to offer, whether it's help with a bill, whether it's food networks, just whatever I need in my life, I know how to get it. A lot of people don't, which is a lot of the reasoning behind my advocating for people that need assistance with certain things. I think it should be advertised, the resources in Boston.

And again, sometimes it's who you know, what agency you know, who you know that got this assistance before.

And once I graduated high school and college and started working and having children, and I have three adult children and I have three grandchildren as well. And I've just been thinking of it lately because where I live, I live in a complex of 60 town homes, and the management company that works for us, supposedly, they're so unprofessional. They're just so... I would say slumlords if they were our landlords, but I don't call them landlords because they're a management company, but they're the worst. They're so unprofessional. They can't keep a maintenance team together for two seconds. It's just a mess. And I often think, ""If I owned my home or co-owned my home, we wouldn't have to deal with waiting for this or them coming to do this or that."" And I'll admit, I've been a section eight recipient since 1974, 1972 actually, when I moved out from my mom's home. And I've been able to maintain that, thank God, and live in Boston. Of course, the rents are just through the roof, as you all know, but home-ownership, I've been thinking about it lately, Carmen, and I have a son-in-law that he was a vet. I mean, he fought in the army and now he works for the state, and I've just been saying, ""Buy something so that we can co-own. Buy a home or have it built and build me a little, how they call it, the in-law home, or in-law unit next to it or near it. And that way you can receive the rent that I pay, the rent that the state, this year, that they pay as well."" But he's, for some reason, not wanting to do that. But just home-ownership would be so great because you have so much more of a say so in making your home as comfortable as you want it, instead of having to wait and go through the headache of people that aren't doing what they're supposed to do. So I live here right in Dorchester, and I've always thought home-ownership should be out in the suburbs somewhere. But no, I'd love to own a home right here somewhere in Dorchester, because I lived in Dorchester, Mattapan, since I've been in Boston, and I just love it. I don't always love what's going on outside of my door, but I love Dorchester, I really do. And I'd like to own a home here and the homes that they have here just cost so much. I don't foresee that happening, but I'm onboard with you, Carmen. I'd love to be a homeowner. I think we all should be homeowners if we could, but I know that's not...

And I find it kind of irritating that it's not celebrated because it is such an amazing accomplishment. And I've taken language classes and I keep telling people I struggle with English, but I think it's amazing and it upsets me that it is not celebrated, it is not considered one of the great benefits of Boston.

We're smart and interestingly, we were able to buy the house way back when, under its previous incarnation, so I know about them. But going back to that kind of idea that I never thought... I know people choose to rent as opposed to buying houses, but that was always the default for me, is to buy a house. So I find that kind of interesting. And as I said, I would never be able to buy it now. I refer to this as I was kicked off the socioeconomic ladder. And I use the word kicked off very clearly. So when people start talking about accessing resources and everything like that and advertising, I didn't know that it was a big divide. And it's a communication divide. And somebody actually said to me, she said, ""My parents, my mother was a single mother on welfare."" And we were having this conversation, there's a lot to this, so nobody get offended if this comes out wrong, because it was a long conversation that went with this. And she said, ""I can't imagine what it's like for you to not even understand how to apply for these things.""

So you find yourself in these places that at the beginning middle school was tough because, you were that kid who got bullied on because you didn't speak the language. But, because they don't know that in the Hispanic culture bullying people is a norm. So I already came with a tough skin. It didn't affect me at all. But, at the end of the day, it was very hard to make friends, to speak to other people because there was that language barrier, right?

So even electing somebody that's willing to push forward with the implementations, housing for the homeless, better school, this and that, they still have to answer to our governor and basically, he's not on the same mindset as they are, as far as I'm concerned, personally.

Because the governor is over the mayor, and they can't implement anything with first consulting him, working around him, them city counselors too, and if he says no, then it's no.

So there are three parts of that that I wanted bring up in the experience. So last year I did some program at the Mass Historical Society on voting during a pandemic. And in the middle of that, one of the things in that is they talked about how James Michael Curley, if anybody's been in by Faneuil Hall, you see the statue of him, how James Michael Curley and Honey Fitzgerald, who was mayor of Boston and the grandfather of John F. Kennedy, had this real fight and they actually changed the law at that point. So James Michael Curley, who was mayor of Boston, could not have consecutive term. I thought that was hysterical. My father's a history buff and so I talked to him about that while I was driving him over to his appointment, I don't know, over there. Please don't even ask me which hospital it was at that point. And oh, and he said, ""Oh yeah, my father used to work on James Michael Curley's campaigns."" And I'm like, ""What?"" I was completely amazed. And he told me the story about my great-uncle was at a Curley rally and Curley pointed to him and said, ""You, Kid, you look cold."" And he gave him the coat off his back. And so that coat stuck around the family for years. We later found out, when I looked into this whole thing, that he actually used to keep coats in his car, so every rally he would do, he would take his coat off and give it to some kid in the group. But anyway, it turned my family into like standout campaigns and everything like that. About the same time I drove my father over to his appointment and we're coming back through Mission Hill, and he's pointing out where his grandparents had lived before they moved to Roxbury. And then he kind of muttered off his oldest brother who was kind of the black sheep of the family, he said, ""Jimmy never left Mission Hill."" So I started thinking about those things and there were a number of other things. It's like my father, when they were doing busing, the early meetings on busing, we were in the public school and the reason my parents actually took us out of the public school was because my father went to every meeting, and he kept telling people that this tract of area, that they had no houses on, the map they were living that they had was... His house was in the middle of it and he had six kids. And they kept saying, ""We'll figure it out when the time comes."" And his whole attitude was, ""Well, we're not going to figure it out.

As I was listening to everybody, I always asked the question of whoever's coming into my neighborhood, whether it's my neighborhood or my neighboring neighborhood, ""What are you going to do for us in our neighborhood? How are you going to treat our neighborhood if I decide to let you in to my network of people to talk to them to figure out what they want? What is the end result? How are you going to represent us statistically? How are you going to talk about us in a way that highlights and celebrates all of our diversity?"" Which you were talking about Somala, which is something that I always talk about. And then, the other thing that we, well, I always think about is that the leadership comes in different forms and this is something that Jasmine said, and why is it that people are always looking for leadership to look a certain way? Leadership looks so different with so many different people in our neighborhoods. I often wonder about the youth in our neighborhood, everybody's looking for the shiny, bright youth in our neighborhood. What about the youth that are struggling? They could be shiny and bright too. Invest in them, which is something somebody else said. I'm sorry my memory's a little [inaudible]. But, why do we have to pick and choose who we speak to, and why do we need gatekeepers to protect our neighborhood and our neighbors? Why do we need to protect them? So, all this is all about the way City and institutions have treated our neighborhoods and the people that live here. I know that I raised two Afro-Latinas and they struggle so hard in the paths that they've chosen. One in trauma, following my footsteps, and the other one decided, she's at school, ""Everybody I'm just going into the Military."" So it was a little shock. But she went into the Military where you don't see too many Latinas in the field that she's in. She's in chemicals. So, I struggle and fight with different institutions and different people for them to understand that our neighborhoods are worth fighting for and that we need to fight, not with each other, but to empower each other, which is something that you all have said in different ways. So I'm just all over the place because I agree with everything everybody said. And I have an accent but you only hear it when I'm angry and you only hear the southern part.

They don't get a, hey, we're working on this. Hey, what is your opinion? So, in a little bit of detail from me more in an example to elaborate is, I was appointed by the mayor to serve on the search committee for the superintendent of Boston Public Schools. That was something that a lot of people within our governmental stand were not proud of. They didn't want to talk and they didn't want to see it happen.

I live in Beacon Hill, but don't be fooled. I live in subsidized housing and I have told people on more than one occasion, especially throughout this pandemic, that people don't know that there's a whole lot of invisible, poor people right in this very affluent neighborhood. But I think, as it relates to my questions earlier, housing is a fundamental right. It should be like... And it's a social justice issue. It's a human rights issue and if we have all of this room to build million-dollar McMansions in Dorchester and billion-dollar skyscrapers and high-rises that are sitting empty, we definitely have the ability to build more affordable housing. I saw an article yesterday that the BPDA, which is the Boston Planning and Development Association, I think, they approved something like 940 units of housing for the city of Boston. 172 of those units are listed as affordable. And affordable is a misnomer. We have way more people who are living down in... closer to the extremely low income level in this city, who cannot find housing because it is so ridiculous. But housing-affordable goes all the way up to, in some neighborhoods, $120,000 a year. That is insane. A person who is making $20,000 a year cannot compete in the same market as a person who is making $120,000 a year. And so... But both of those people would qualify for affordable housing in Boston, as it is now. And so those two things really... That really resonated for me, is the housing issue and the lack of affordable housing for people in actual brackets that represent the incomes of the people who need the housing.",south end,"['community trends', 'housing', 'economic opportunity', 'inequality']","['unjust', 'gentrification and displacement', 'housing affordability', 'income', 'class-based']",133.5,267.0

I think it's Pamela that was talking about housing and how she grew up here and over the years has seen a transformation, or what we would call gentrification now. And I think it's a real need. I wasn't born here, so I don't know anything about that, but I have read so much to understand that it's a reality. And so, having spent the last, like I said, spent the last 13 years now, in Boston, I think I could, to a large extent, say I have seen it, but also I have listened to many stories. It resonates with me and I think too, to that point, is that having conversations like this and making sure that folks like Pamela, and many others who have lived here, do not leave here to go to Brockton or go to another place, it's real. And so we need to fight together. It is, whether you are new to Boston or just coming to Boston yesterday, or even arrive in Boston today, the conversation should be ongoing. I think too, and then to Kelly's point with the mental crisis, anytime I drive past the Methadone Miles I weep for this country. One, I know I'm a Nigerian, so in case you're wondering who did this, so keep talking, and I've traveled around the world to know when I see [inaudible], it baffles me that we live in a country with so much abundance and yet people are dying. It's... I just can't understand what's happening, but yet it feels like this happened in my country. It's going to be all over the world that Nigeria is blah, blah, blah. All of those African countries are black, but yet if I could take pictures and show it to my folks in Nigeria, they will laugh at me. But anyway, that's a different conversation. So I say that this is a reality, and we have to do that together, irrespective of where we come from. Whether you're old or new, it's a fight that we have to do and I think, like I said, I'm also coming from a spiritual... Today's kind of a day that the Lord has made. But I remember this, just this in regards to the Old Testament, sorry, I'm going to go a little bit fate, where the Bible talks about even those that are poor, the rich, when they go to glean their land, the Bible tells us that they allow, they don't glean everything, they allow for the poor. But we don't see that happen now. What we see is the people who claim everything and the poor doesn't have opportunity to glean behind them. And so when people go to harvest, what I'm saying is that they leave something for the poor. And what we're seeing is that the rich, [inaudible] goes grab everything is that's there. They grab as much as they could. They could even clear everything so the poor doesn't have anything on the street. And that's the result of what we see happen here. And so that's one story that resonates with me. And, like I said, I'm here. Part of the rules, it goes to tie to my own passion of seeing young people, that they don't have to live like their parents. I've got two boys and this is a fight that I have to do for them.

When I say that, there is nothing in Boston, like it was before. For our children, there're no centers, there're no activities. There's nothing to make them feel like they belong to the city of Boston. We have to fight so how for them. My experience in my life goes back to my three sons. I was a single mother and I was raising three sons, and all I heard all through their lives was statistics, crime. You know they're not going to be this, they are not going to be that. You know people were putting them down, their peer people were putting them down as a young African American child. Schools, Community Centers. Just people that they looked up too. So, that led me to fight for them. To travel with them. To make sure that they're okay. To make sure that they earn and get what they need to get out of Boston as I did for a child that my mother gave me. I wanted them to believe in their selves that they can accomplish anything in life. They could do anything they want in life. Nothing, no word, no action could take place in theirs lives that would stop them. That just made me get more into their education. It made me follow through their education, until I made sure that they were okay to able to stand up and finish the rest of their lives as men. To not be statistics, not go to jail, not do this, not do that. The city of Boston has to understand that it is all about our children. We have lived our lives, we have done everything in our lives, and we have a lot of children here that are suffering and can not get the quality lives that we already had, and it's not fair to them. So, my mission is to fight for our children. My place in Boston in the future, I want to have the biggest organization for the children because they have so much talent, and so much to offer, and I want to be a voice for them. I want to carry their voices on my back, and once we get where we are going I want to take them off my back and put them in front of me and make sure that they are able to talk as loud as they can and accomplish everything they can.

Sometimes you have to have it where it's promoted, where there would be, like how a lot of the community gets together when we have festivals or we have carnivals and things like that, I think that's a great way to get people to come together and try to bring some type of change, like maybe some type of campaign where you can present it to them and they'll be willing to get involved that way.

We need to be secure. And what we get we need to be able to keep it. We need to have something that can't be taken away from us. Like, if we get housing and we buy these houses in the community, I'm concerned about somebody coming in and offering somebody three or four times what their house is worth so that they can blockbust the community. And pretty much like Priscilla was saying with gentrification, when they want it they just come back and take it. We need some protection against that. And, the equality part of that is that it needs to be in the communities of color. Like I said, I live in what's called the West End. It's right next to North End with the Italians. Their equity is passed down through their families, their generations. They keep theirs. So, I worked at Unity Bank back in the day in the 70s and I watched money flowing through Boston. And we had opportunities then for equity. It's about education. We're not educating our young people to say, okay, we don't need those Jordan sneakers, we don't need this that and the other, we need stuff that we're going to be able to pass down to generations. We're going to leave a legacy. So, that's with my issue. That's my experience that has led me to this. I'd watched people just lose everything, and get pushed out. That's my experience.

And I don't think any of the candidates really answered this well is how can we make housing more equitable for everyone in Boston? I've been homeless twice, due to domestic violence. Actually right when the Long Island shelter was closed, right before the hundred inches of snow that we got that winter and I'm grateful and privileged and blessed to have gotten housing after a few months of that. But I observed like when I go over to doctor's appointments over at BMC or being around methadone bile or mass and cast, as some people call it and the situation has gotten more out in the open and it makes me sad and just disappointed to see people not housed. I know that there's some small group that like to be outside because it's hard to be in a shelter, but I don't feel like the city is really doing enough. And I realized that it takes time to build housing, but I wish the city would make an even more stronger stance. And I don't mean just treatment, but having things like there's something called the housing first model where you don't put a ton of rules in front of someone and say, ""You have to be six months sober or you have to stay in the shelter for three months before we'll fill out your verification of homelessness form."" All these things that just make it that much harder. It's harder to be sober when you're out on the streets. And so, I feel if we had a more listed... I mean, I can't have all the solutions, it's complicated and we could spend literally a whole day talking about just this topic. So for me, I'd like to see the homeless get more shelter and get housing and also to people who've lived here for decades and have been here, I don't like seeing people pushed out to the suburbs, to other states.

And I know that housing as an issue began somewhere in the 70s, with veterans returning and two things, war is hell. So many veterans come return home, male and female, with a lot of issues that there should be institutions there to help people resolve their issues of what's now known as PTSD. That wasn't even a channel to turn to, if you will. Over all of our wars as this country, there been no notifications and the name has changed to protect the innocent. But at same time, you did not see the numbers of homelessness that you do now. And again, it's started in a very different time. You also had a situation under I believe, maybe Ronald Reagan, if any youngins can remember that, where the deinstitutionalization of folks who had issues not necessarily war related, but had mental health issues, spiritual issues that were in an essence turned out into the streets. Because the theme at the time is, well, we can find a place for them to come and get their medication. And they can self medicate, and blah, blah, blah, which was absolute down to Coca Cola. Now you move to a time now, where the bottom is beginning to become thicker, because of our social economic situation, Nancy spoke to and please don't misunderstand. But her position as a white person in Boston, even with that, there were prevailing kinds of situations economically, socially, that have now thickened again, the bottom of people who otherwise would not have the same worries or concerns. And how do we take that super huge problem and crystallize it and stop the life out of it, if you will, to bring it to the larger body because the body of people who are falling under that social economic state is growing. And it's including everybody, people who maybe once thought that they were safe. When you think about homelessness and you think about people in this town, in this city, who are second generation homeless. I'm not talking about just falling off to a corner somewhere.

I live in one of the most hottest neighborhoods ever, was opium all pleasant. And I know that those neighborhoods are notorious if you look into Boston history, but as of right now, it's very gentrified and what we will call it watered down, basically, compared to what odds are, well, just nothing but neighborhoods where people defended themselves at a certain type of period.

I'm 23 years old, but I lived in the city for so long and I've also been born and raised here within and New York. So I was raised here and I was also raised in the Bronx, but one thing I've understood is, not all minorities are accepted in every neighborhood. We used to go into Lower Allston or even Little Italy or even North End, and those kind of areas, you don't really see any of these operators or even businesses in that area. So to say, there is a restriction between Boston and Natives and then coming back to Bruce's ideal is why can't we not all live in peace, but for understanding is the reason why we can't leave in peace because we live under different tax brackets. So as me, I'm a Roxbury native. I could go as far as South End and feel included because there's many Latinos living there. But as a Roxbury native, when I was working in Cambridge, I felt excluded. I felt like I wasn't a part of that neighborhood, even though that neighborhood is, it's two cities in one. So it's very difficult to say or to view that. Okay, I'm from Boston, I'm from the bean, I'm a Red Sox fan. I'm the official patriarch. There's things of that nature, where we are all implemented in, but at the same time, we can't just all cross each other's regions. So my thing is when is it that it's going to be acceptable as me as a Roxbury native, that I'm accepted in Downtown Boston? Now it's very hard because I know the city has different on plans where they're putting in new housings, they're putting in new programs that doesn't really abide by Boston residential people. It only abides by people outside of the city or the ones that are coming in because Boston is technically known as the hub. So being the hub, that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. So being that means we're bringing in different businesses from all over the world. And a couple years ago, we was known as the number one city in the country. So my thing is, when is it that the people from our city are going to be accepted in our city?

I've been doing civic engagement, voter registration for years. And the thing that really hurts me most is a person say, ""Why should I vote? My vote don't count."" And I look and I've been saying, ""Yes, it's good to register, but you need to educate these people."" Just because you register them, it doesn't mean they're going to vote. You need to register them and then follow them, whichever way. Like MassVOTE is one of them that really gets out to other organizations to help with that and I've been doing phone banking for years and the Get Out The Vote issue. And, we need to hold elected officials accountable. That's how I got a lot of things done in the [A-leagues 01:04:00]. I knew from the governor, except for Baker, all the governors down and the mayors, and even though we only had one for 20 years and then... but anyway, I knew him, and the city councils, right? But, it's a matter of you letting them know you're not going to just sit back and let them do what they want, because I would tell them quick, ""I voted you in, I'll vote you out, or I'll run for your office."" But, even though I'll never do that. But it's just, I'm serious, we start with our kids now and then, well, we have to start with the older ones. I'm a senior. I live in a senior housing, right? And, I don't think half of the seniors in here are registered to vote. But I know the ones are, it's a strong group. But, we need all of the elders to... Well, we're powerful and everybody know seniors go and vote before anybody else. It's a matter of holding them accountable. And like I'm a lifetime member of the NAACP, and I would go to the conventions, right? And what they do in Washington, they have a report card for everybody in Washington. This is the NAACP national. And I've been saying, ""We need to do that in state, especially Massachusetts."" We need to see what bills they're passing, which ones they're not supporting, and have a record of that, and have it where it's somewhere online or somewhere that the community could go and look at it and form their own opinions, because I think we need to stop telling people who to vote for. We need to tell them you go do your own research and find out. Don't vote for someone because Sarah said you could vote for them. I heard people say, ""Well, Sarah, don't tell them this because they'll go back and say Sarah told me to do this."" So, [inaudible]. But that's my opinion. And that's why I really believe in the voter registration, voter education. Like with my kids, when they turned 18, my nieces and nephews, I would do a voter registration event for all of them that turned 18. And I told my kids, ""You better not come back in the house unless you voted."" So, these are the things we need to do.

I mean, some of these people that are running have been operating like this for years. So we need to let them know that we pay a salary. You're supposed to represent us. And if you continue to operate like this then we are going to remove you. However, we need everybody. We need the blacks. We need the Latinos. We need the Asian. We need the white folks. We need everybody to be saying the same thing to these elected officials because we get it. We know we don't get the services because we don't come out and vote. And that's insane that we continue to ride our bumpy roads, that we continue that we're the last ones getting our trash dump. We can't go through the process of signing up with the City as a vendor for procurement because their process is so long and intimidating that we can't get through it. We don't have organizations that help us with our back office stuff, either be it nonprofit or whether it be a construction worker. We have a lot of construction workers, they have their own businesses, but they don't know how to do the back office stuff. They don't know how to bid on their projects. So they under bid and they don't make any money. I mean, I've seen so much. And I'm telling you, that's what makes me fight and talk the way I do, because I've seen it. I've been in it. And I'm tired of it because it's so unfair. I've been in banking. I worked for the Mass Affordable Housing Alliance helping folks with their first time home buying. Remember when we all got Red Line? I mean, the system continues and continues to beat us down. And who runs the system? White men. Because you have all these white men that are in government that now Washington's been shook up because there's a lot of women coming in, women of color, and that's what we need to do. We need to not only look at the City but we need to look at the state of Massachusetts, because we are getting ready to get a governor next year. There's going to be redistricting, so there's going to be seats up for running. And that's what we need to have. We need to have people that look like us, reflect the synergism and the legislators. Governor Baker doesn't even have a black person on his cabinet. So how are they representing us when he don't even have nobody like us on his cabinet. These are the things that we need to be questioning and then asking them. I asked Michelle Wu, ""Is your cabinet going to look like the people that you serve?"" Because we don't want to go backwards.

The big thing is that all of us have our own experience with our personal story. But I think the problem was that it happen very subtle in the system. Nobody talk to nobody.

So, it's really hard to have that across sector collaboration to ensure that would be across the board, because we know that we all have scarce resourcing and we all try to fight for the pie, but not [inaudible] and collaborate, not working together in that context.

But the big thing for me in terms of how can we ensure that everything is interconnected, and how can we leverage that collaboration, partnership? And a lot of that has to come from cross work community. And I think the bigger thing would be the budget and funding. Budget and funding have not been equitably distributed across all different sectors. Some who might have more of a voice, some who might be able to speak up and speak out, those are the one who always receive the most. However, there's so many different other community day agency or faith-based agency who do the good job who really out in the community and a lot of them also doing from their heart with the husband, but the officers doesn't [inaudible].

So we need to hold them all accountable, especially where we live in our communities. They come in our communities, they campaign, and they promise stuff. We don't see the changes. They know what we need. It's not like they don't know what we need. I'll give you a perfect example. Mass Cass. Now, we have this city that is spreading. It's spreading almost like a disease on your skin. You know what I mean? They saw this coming. They've seen it in other cities, and they knew when there was I think 25 tents down there. They saw that. They knew it. They didn't address it. They said they knew there was a problem and they were going to create committees to explore, and they have all these different phrases and things that they use when they want to back you up off of them. So, there's over 200 now. There's a rat infestation there. The community down that way cannot continue to operate. The food pantry is down there. The big food pantry for Boston is down there. It's unsafe. You have people down there who are mentally ill. They're not responsible. So, people seen this coming. I've heard so much [inaudible] about it. Everybody has their take on it but nobody's doing anything about it. Now, and even with the ones that are running for mayor, it comes up in every conversation just about. They knew that it was there. These people didn't just fall off the chicken truck. They have been in the position to do something about that all the time. They have been in political positions, all of them, and especially these two that are running. So they knew. So when Oanh was talking about holding people accountable to their promises, we don't want to just hear you say what we want to hear at the time and get our votes. My vote is very important. I came from the generation where I heard about the stories about them closing down the polls. My mother and my aunts and uncles and all of them, it wasn't safe. They would burn down your house and kill your whole family. Lynch you in public so that it would deter the other people from stepping up and wanting to vote or wanting to be an advocate for voting. So, my vote is very important. We do need to hold these people accountable. When we don't see something being done when there's a promise that you made, and this is an age old issue.

And in that class, it talked about somewhat like privilege, right? So what I learned was that white people are minorities. I said, ""Okay, so you tell me how that different from a urban community who majority are minorities."" So what I was informed is because they don't have access to a lot of different resources because they make a dollar more or a hundred dollars more, or $2,000 more. And so that's why they don't qualify for a lot of services or resources that is around. And so what I want to say in the urban community or overall across the state or the state that they reside in. And so when I learned that I had to go back and kind of really, really dig in, like, okay... So for the household, if it's a household family, two parents in the household, yes, their income is going to escalate, right? And so maybe that one person, one of the members who is the breadwinner, maybe something happens along the way. And then, so they still minimize all the resources they can get they're entitled to because maybe the other member of the household who was the half of the breadwinner still makes too much money because they make over 60, 70,000 a year, right? So because of that, they still not entitled, but they did become minorities. That's complicated. So it's so complicated because who set the barriers of what these words mean? Where it comes from? Where does it resonate from? Mm-hmm (affirmative). So that's what I find such a differ in how you classify Caucasian or white, black, however you want to put it, black, brown, and beige.

I'm mixed, I'm clearly mixed. Well I can't say that really. But I'm African and Southern European and just like, I heard stuff like people referring to me as like a member of Al Qaeda at the age of eight years old. Then like I remember I was walking to Boston Bowl and everybody knows Boston Bowl in Boston. I live near Boston Bowl. I still live in the same place and literally, I'm walking there to go play games at the arcade and I am now 11 at this point. A car full of young men, who are probably from a different part of Dorchester, they pulled up and they said, he said, ""Oh you know, where are the bombs? Can I get the bomb off of you now?"" Then they just all laughed. I heard the clinking of beers and they just drove off really fast and just like, that made me think of that. So I connected briefly in that moment to that. Then just like overall, about the schooling and what you were saying earlier, Bianca, about just the really big differences in the schooling and I think a lot about how like other of my peers, who also did get held back, didn't stay. They were just like, ""All right, if I'm going to get held back, then I might as well stay home, or I'll just go to another school where they don't even take attendance."" Those are all really real things and some of those people who I'm just now mentioning, I see them, it was in the last five or six years and they were in prison, or they are imprisoned, incarcerated, or they are dead. I remember seeing the news and seeing my friend Rudy, who I knew was in foster care and stuff, he was in a shoot out with the police in like 2016 and he passed away as a result. I knew that his attendance was really bad, back in elementary school. So schooling has a huge impact on how a youth's life can turn out as an adult. Racism also, has a huge impact on how a youth can turn out as an adult. So you know, these are institutions of inequality. They were made this way for an original purpose that we could argue back and forth on for hours, but it's a matter of fact that our youth are getting harmed, in school and outside of school, on the way to playing games and stuff like that and not everybody can just tough it out and just whatever, pull them up by these imaginary bootstraps that we keep hearing about.

Seeing the way that the city highlights gentrification as a positive thing, has been something that's been on my mind, just because seeing the brochures for these newer housing complexes and stuff and it's just like, ""It's like newly gentrified neighborhood"", you know what I mean? So now I'm like, [inaudible]. But you know what I mean? Yeah, connotation and context is super important, like as far as the communities go. But I definitely resonate with the stories that you both shared. Obviously, as someone who lived in Roxbury and Grove Hall, my entire life and now I'm living in the North End, because it's more affordable than where I used to live, is like that's a direct result of the ways that my community is currently and has been gentrified. I think that it's important also to recognize that for many different people, their circumstances are different. You know what I mean? We have different lived experiences and different like economic, we have different I guess ideas of economic stability and lived experiences with that, as well. So my story is like very different from a lot of other people's, but being someone who is the youngest and I never take youngest sibling, you know what I mean, like slander, because I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. But yeah, you know what I mean? Like being the youngest of a household of four children, two of whom were like adopted. It's like, kind of the idea of community that I share, or that I have and that I hold dear, is like very different than a lot of other people. I definitely think that seeing the gentrification that's taking place right now, it's very reminiscent of how the community kind of felt very disparate when I was younger, do you know what I mean? Because, you have people that you're close to, you have your kind of blood relatives and your blood family members and stuff like that. But then you also have these like adopted family members who are like, you want to care about and who are like they're a part of your family and you go to love them and stuff like that.

I feel like the people that are moving into the neighborhoods, they're not to blame for the gentrification that's taking place. It's more so around the foundations that are being laid by the city to be able to have those people move in. You know what I mean? I think that divide is something that happens a lot. I saw that happen like my own household, just like with adopted siblings and myself. You know what I mean, with my birth mom and sister, it's just like, it's easy for us to fight each other and kind of not like each other, because it's like, ""Oh you're this and this and you know whatever.""

Like there can be like space for people to be able to live in affordable housing and I mean there can be [inaudible] folks who are, you know what I mean? Like whether they're a part of the artist community or they're a part of the business community, whatever, to be able to find space. Because there shouldn't be that, like one group of people shouldn't be pushed out for another group of people to be able to thrive. You feel me? I feel like until the city has that in mind, so that concept gets through their skulls, we're not going to be able to have a clear understanding of who, of what community actually feels like.

Y yo me pregunto: ""Boston es una ciudad que tiene un sinfín de servicios, hospitales, universidades, es una ciudad turística; es una ciudad que tiene un montón de componentes que la hace interesante para vivir y para el turista. Pero ¿adónde cree la ciudad de Boston que va a encontrar mano de obra o la fuerza pujante, que somos la comunidad inmigrante, para tener todas estas escuelas, hospitales o restaurantes en pie? Porque, independientemente que nos movamos para ciudades más lejos o más cómodas, las distancias son grandes y se dificultará esta clase que no podemos pagar una renta, venir a trabajar a Boston. ¿Y por qué le digo esto? Por mi experiencia, yo tengo 20 años viviendo en Boston y en los últimos años para mí ha sido un esfuerzo sobrehumano pagar la renta. Y moverme no es una opción en este momento, porque mi hija depende de una beca, que tiene que vivir en Boston, yo he comenzado un trabajo en la ciudad de Boston. Entonces, moverme de Boston a mí me limita y me quita un montón de oportunidades, pero a la vez, vivir en Boston, con esta crisis que hay de vivienda, me dificulta otras cosas. Entonces, ¿hacia dónde se ve Boston? Se ve sin una fuerza trabajadora como la comunidad inmigrante en un par de futuros con esta gran crisis de vivienda que hay. ¿Qué piensan las autoridades de Boston sobre la crisis de vivienda? Porque todo el mundo se pronuncia, pero el latino a veces cree la gente que va a sobrevivir y no. Hay gente que ahora tiene dos, tres trabajos para pagar la renta. Y no es que estemos pidiendo que nos den nada regalado, no, a nosotros no nos gusta que nos regalen las cosas. Pero sí creo que no se han puesto a pensar que hay una clase trabajadora que no va a poder seguir viviendo en Boston. Y que se oye bonito cuando dicen: ""No, vamos a hacer el control de renta, la vivienda es un problema"". Pero nadie ha hecho nada realmente como para pararla.

Sometimes you have to have it where it's promoted, where there would be, like how a lot of the community gets together when we have festivals or we have carnivals and things like that, I think that's a great way to get people to come together and try to bring some type of change, like maybe some type of campaign where you can present it to them and they'll be willing to get involved that way. Sometimes you have to draw people in with, not saying it has to be something attached to it, but it's almost like there's a time and a place to deal with in order to get people to really get involved.

And I've seen a lot of inequality, and a lot of people struggling to survive, and not even having the minimum needs met. And I think gentrification has not been something that has helped either. And I think that there has not been enough help around the Latino community based parts in Boston. And I think with the pandemic we saw that happen a lot. I'm a journalist, and so I was able to talk to a lot of people, and to write about a lot of these things. And I had a really rough time realizing how much this community was ignored. And how if it wasn't in English, they just wouldn't know. There were like... Even information was not available to a lot of people, because he wasn't in Spanish. I've even seen the translations are not even done correctly either. So it's just a bunch of people not even able to realize or understand what was going on. Especially in a time through... For example, when the pandemic it started, it was really hard for people to even know what was happening. And what was the right to do and what was not right to do. And so I felt very much like the community was ignored. And so sometimes I... I guess that's why my question is, is there a future in which communities whose first language is not English, or who struggle with immigration because of how they got here, is there a future for them? And is there space for them? And a lot of them, for example, when it comes to the census, they're to this day terrified to look at it, to answer it, to be like, ""Yes, I'm here."" So there's not a real statistic on which you can say, there's this many people in East Boston or in Chelsea. Of there's this many Latinos here who are this many. People here with this many families, with this many... You don't fully know because a lot of them will not even open the door. Because they're obviously terrified of giving their information, and saying how many people live here or... Which leads to not having enough resources for people who do live there.

It's an extraordinary amount of money. And if I had to do it at the market rate, with the current way that things are done for rentals, I wouldn't be able to stay in Boston at all. I would not be here. And it's interesting to me, Sophia, my family is Italian, and we lived in East Boston. Came through East Boston and it's another generation, and I watched the Italians leave East Boston. And I watched a lot of people from Central America and Latino people come in. My grandmother stayed until her death, but the community changed tremendously. And East Boston has always been a portal for immigration since colonization took hold and was begun. And so it's really interesting, and very truly upsetting to hear your question. And it dovetails with my question, in so far as who is here, and what's going on? I feel like the entire city is becoming corporatized. And my great aunt owns the house that I lived in, and she can't afford to be a landlord. She can't afford the taxes, and the water bill, and the...

And I think that the culture of developers that took hold in the last 20 years, is transforming the cities in ways that I don't fully understand what the future of the city will be, and who will be living here. So that's my personal experience also in terms of why I feel that way, and it really does distress me. I guess I'm third generation Bostonian in the immigrant lineage. My daughters have lived her, their whole lives, but they're only 12 and 15. And I don't really foresee that we are going to stay Bostonians, which makes me sad. Because concurrent to that, I went to Boston public schools. I know people at every level of the city in terms of public servants within education, at city hall, friends and family, community members. I'm part of my community here in Dorchester as a mother and a parent. And all of these things have tremendous, this is my life. And so not having seized the opportunity to be a homeowner 25, 30 years ago. I just think was rapidly... it's clear to me it's too late. Unless my income changes significantly, which is not to say that's impossible. But as I balance motherhood, and parental responsibilities, and work, which I share in common with every working pay parent to. To ratchet up income to be able to stay here is less likely, if I'm going to maintain that balance, and do a good job as a parent as well. So, these are huge questions having to do with generational presence here in Boston.
